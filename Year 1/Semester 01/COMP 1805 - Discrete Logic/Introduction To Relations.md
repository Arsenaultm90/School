A **Relationship** is an association that expresses the way two or more entities are connected.
The **Cartesian Product** of $A$ and $B$ is the set of all possible ordered pairs of the form $(x, y)$ where $x \in A$ and $y \in B$.

**Binary Relation :**
	A **binary relation** R between two sets A and B is a subset of the Cartesian product $A×B$. That is:$$\displaylines{R⊆A×B}$$
	If $(a, b) \in R$, we say that $a$ is related to $b$ by $R$, often written as $a R b$.

 **Reflexive Relation :**
	A binary relation $R$ on $A$ is **reflexive** if every element in $A$ is related to itself.
	That is: $$\displaylines{\forall x \in A,\; (x, x) \in R}$$
	This means that for every $x$ in $A$, the pair $(x,x)$ must be included in $R$.
		Note: The 'is equal to' comparison is true for all pairs but does not define a reflexive relation in totality. It is a more restrictive variation of the subset.
