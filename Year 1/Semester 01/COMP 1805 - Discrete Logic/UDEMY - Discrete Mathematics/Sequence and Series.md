##### Sequence
A list of things.

Ex.$$\displaylines{2, 4, 6, 8, \dots \\
\text{Sequence:}\; 2n}$$

##### Arithmetic Sequences
An **Arithmetic Sequence** is a sequence of values where the progression is the addition or subtraction of a constant value, known as the **common difference**.

Ex. $$\displaylines{3, 9, 15, 21, \dots \\
\text{Sequence:}\; n+6 \\ \text{Common Difference: }6}$$
Find $n^{th}$ term:$$\displaylines{n^{th} = a +(n-1)d\\a=\text{First Term }\\ d = \text{Common Difference}}$$

##### Geometric Sequences
A **Geometric Sequence** is a sequence of values where the progression is the product of the previous value with a constant term, known as the **common ratio**.

Ex.$$\displaylines{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \dots \\
\text{Sequence: }n*2\\ \text{Common Ratio: } 2}$$
Find the $n^{th}$ term: $$\displaylines{n^{th} = ar^{n-1} \\
a = \text{First Term}\\
r = \text{Common Ratio}}$$

##### Partial Sums Of Geometric Sequences
$$S_{n} = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$
