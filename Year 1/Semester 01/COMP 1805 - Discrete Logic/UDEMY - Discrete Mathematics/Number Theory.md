##### Parity
Defining an integer as **Even** or **Odd**.
$k$ = Integer

**Even**
$x = 2k$

**Odd**
$x = 2k +1$

**Properties**
Addition
	Even + Even = Even
	Even + Odd = Odd
	Odd + Odd = Even

Multiplication
	Even * Even = Even
	Even * Odd = Even
	Odd * Odd = Odd

##### Divisibility
$n, d \in ℤ\;|\;d \neq 0$
$\frac{d}{n} \leftrightarrow \exists k\;|\;n=d\times k$

**Divisibility Rules**
1. Divisibility by 1: All integers are divisible by 1.
2. Divisibility by 2: The last digit of the integer has to be even.
3. Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
4. Divisibility by 4: The last two digits are divisible by 4.
5. Divisibility by 5: The last digit is 0 or 5.

##### Prime Numbers
1. Integers greater than 1.
2. The only divisors are themselves and 1.

**The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetics**
The theorem states that we can get any non-prime number by the product of two prime numbers.

∴ We can say that any non-prime number is a **Composite** number.

##### Prime Factorization
The process of finding the prime factors of a composite number.

1. Divide the number by the smallest prime number
2. If it doesn't result in an integer, choose the next smallest prime number.
3. Get the result of the division and repeat step one until we arrive at 1.

**Unique Prime Number Factorization Theorem**
The prime factors of a composite number are the only prime numbers where the product will equal the composite number.

##### Greatest Common Divisors(GCD) & Least Common Multiple(LCM)
**GCD:** Greatest common divisor between two or more numbers.

Ex. $$\displaylines{1,2,4\;|\;4\\1,2,5,10\;|\;10\\
∴ The\;GCD\;of\;4\;and\;10\;is\;2.}$$

**LCM:** Smallest common multiple between two or more numbers.
We want to search for the greatest number that appears the greatest amount of times.

Ex.$$\displaylines{2*2=4\;|\;'2' is\;the \;only\; factor\; and\; it\; appears\; twice\\2*5=10\;|\;'5'\; is\;the\; greatest\; factor\\2*2*5=20}$$
∴ The lowest common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20.


There also exists a formula: $$LCM(a,b) = \frac{|a*b|}{GCD(a,b)}$$
Ex.$$\displaylines{a = 4\\b=10\\
LCM(4, 10) = \frac{40}{2} = 20}$$
We arrive at the same results as we did in the example above.
