##### Functions
A **Function** is a relation that uniquely associates each member of one set with exactly one member of another set.

$f(x) = x^2$ where,
	$x$ = Input
	$x^2$ = Output
	$f(x)$ = Ruleset

**Input**  is our **Domain**
**Output** is our **Range**

Ex.
$$\displaylines{A = \{1, 2, 3\}\\
B=\{1, 4, 9\}\\ \\
f(x) = x^2\\
f(1) = 1^2 = 1\\
f(2) = 2^2 = 4\\
f(3) = 3^2 = 9}$$
We can see that inputs from set $A$ have been mapped to outputs from set $B$.

NOTE - For a function $f(x)$ to exist:
	A single Input cannot associate with two Outputs values. 
	Each Input must associate with a single Output value.
	Two Inputs can associate with a single Output value.
	Not all Outputs require association with an Input

##### Domain
The set of all possible Inputs that can go into a function and not break it, that is, the output is defined.

Ex.
$$\displaylines{f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}\\
\text{Let's choose: }x=1\\
\frac{1}{1-1} = \frac{1}0 = \text{Undefined}}$$
We can see that, if $x=1$ we get an undefined result. This means that '1' cannot be part of the **Domain**, as it does not map to anything in the **Codomain**.

∴ The Domain = $x \in ℝ\;|\; x \neq 1$

---

##### Range
The set of all possible **Outputs** that can come out of a function.

Ex.
$$\displaylines{f(x) = x^2\\
f(2) = 2^2 = 4\\
f(3) = 3^2 = 9}$$
The **Range** will be all values from ℤ, where $x$ is greater than, or equal to, zero.
	$x \in ℤ\;|\;x \geq 0$

---

##### Function Composition
The process of combining two, or more, functions together to get a new function.

Ex.
$$\displaylines{f(x) = x+1,\; g(x) = x^2\\
f(g(x))= x^2 + 1}$$

---

##### Function Combination
Performing arithmetic processes to functions.

Ex.
$$\displaylines{f(x) = x^2\\
g(x) = x+1\\ \\
\text{Addition}\\
f(x) + g(x)\\
x^2 + (x+1)\\
x^2 +x+1\\ \\
\text{Subtraction}\\
f(x) - g(x)\\
x^2 - (x+1)\\
x^2-x-1\\ \\

\text{Multiplication}\\
f(x) · g(x)\\
x^2 · (x+1)\\
x^3 + x^2 \\ \\
\text{Division}\\
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\
\frac{x^2}{x+1}
}$$


---

##### Even and Odd Functions
**Definition:** $$\displaylines{
\text{Even Function}\\
f(x) = f(-x)\\ \\
\text{Odd Function}\\
f(-x) = -f(x)
}$$
Functions with even powers of $x$ will, often, result in even functions.
Functions with odd powers of $x$ will, often, result in odd functions.
To determine, with absolute certainty, the parity of a function, evaluate them with $-x$.

---

##### Injective(One-To-One) Functions
A function is **One-to-One** if no two elements in the **Domain** map to the same value in the **Codomain**.

---

##### Surjective(Onto) Functions
A function is **Onto** if all elements in the **Codomain** are mapped to by at least one element from the **Domain**.

---

##### Bijective(Injective and Surjective) Functions
A function if **Bijective** if it meets the requirements to be **Injective** and **Surjective**.
That is, every element $x$ in the domain $A$ maps to one and only one element $f(x)$ in the codomain $B$ and every element in the **Codomain** is mapped to.

---

##### Inverse Functions
For a function, if the input of a function $f(x)$ maps to an output, then the inverse $f(x)^{-1}$ maps the output to the input.

Ex.$$\displaylines{f(2) = 3\\
f(3)^{-1}=2}$$
