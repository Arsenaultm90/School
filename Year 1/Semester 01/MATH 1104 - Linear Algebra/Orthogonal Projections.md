$\hat{v}$ is called the orthogonal projection of $v$ onto $U$, which is also called the orthogonal projection of $v$ onto the subspace $Span\{u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}\}$.
$z$ is called the component of $v$ orthogonal to $U$.
$v = \hat{v} + z$ is called the orthogonal decomposition of $v$
$$\displaylines{\hat{v} = proj_{u}v = \frac{v路u_{1}}{u_{1}路u_{1}} u_{1} + \dots + \frac{v路u_{n}}{u_{n}路u_{n}} u_{n}\\
z = v - \hat{v}}$$
