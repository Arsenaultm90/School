$\hat{v}$ is called the orthogonal projection of $v$ onto $u$, which is also called the orthogonal projection of $v$ onto the subspace $Span\{u\}$.
$z$ is called the component of $v$ orthogonal to $u$.
$v = \hat{v} + z$ is called the orthogonal decomposition of $v$
$$\displaylines{\hat{v} = proj_{u}v = \frac{v·u}{u·u} u\\
z = v - \hat{v}}$$
