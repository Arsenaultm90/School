#### Main Themes Of The Course

**Data Structures :**
	Ways to organize data on a computer

**Algorithms :**
	Sequence of instructions (on a computer)  
	How our algorithms will act on our data structures  
	We will analyze our algorithms for efficiency

**Abstraction :** 
	Hiding implementation details  
	Present an interface  
		A contract on what functions do  
		(not necessarily how they do it)  
	Abstractions are useful, but all abstractions are leaky  
		...none moreso than a data structure

##### Data Structure
**What is a data structure?**  
	A structure for storing and accessing data  
		Data Representation  
		Data Processing


##### Algorithm  
Sequence of discrete and precise instructions  
We will define our algorithms using pseudo code.  
We will analyze this code using techniques from 1805, and learn some new techniques.  
	Big-O  
	Amortized analysis  
	Probability and expected value


##### Abstractions
Abstraction often means we donâ€™t care about the underlying implementation.  
However, when performance is an issue, we care very much about the implementation.  
	The implementation is leaky  
	Which implementation we use affects runtime and memory
