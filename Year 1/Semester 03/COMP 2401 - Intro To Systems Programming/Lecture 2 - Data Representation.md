#### Bit Models

**Magnitude-only Bit Model**
This model is for non-negative decimal numbers (whole numbers). With an 8-bit value, we can store a value in the range of 0 to 255

In this representation, we consider the leftmost bit to be considered the most-significant bit  
and the rightmost bit as the least-significant bit. (e.g., **1**011010**1**)

| Word Size   | Bits Used | Bytes Used | Number Range                    | C-Data Type        |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| byte        | 8         | 1          | 0 to 255                        | unsigned char      |
| 16-bit Word | 16        | 2          | 0 to 65,535                     | unsigned short int |
| 32-bit Word | 32        | 4          | 0 to 4,294,967,295              | unsigned int       |
| 64-bit Word | 64        | 8          | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 | unsigned long int  |


**Sign-Magnitude Bit Model**  
This model allows negative decimal numbers (whole numbers). It is the simplest strategy for  
representing negative numbers. This allows numbers only in the range of **-127 to +127** for a single byte.

01111110 = 126  
01111111 = 127  
10000000 = -0  
10000001 = -1  
10000010 = -2  
...  
11111110 = -126  
11111111 = -127

If the signs differ, we need to subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, and  
keep the sign of the larger magnitude.
- Step 1: Find the 1's complement of the subtrahend, which means the second number of subtraction.
- Step 2: Add it with the minuend or the first number.
- Step 3: If there is a carryover left then add it with the result obtained from step 2.
- Step 4: If there are no carryovers, then the result obtained in step 2 is the difference of the two numbers using 1's complement binary subtraction.

Example of (126 + -7)  :
	01111110 - 10000111 = 01110111 = 119



**Twoâ€™s Compliment Bit Model**  
This model allows both positive and negative decimal numbers (whole numbers).
Allows numbers only in the range of -128 to +127.
To represent negative numbers ... we take the bits that represent the number as if it were  
positive, then invert (or flip) all of the bits and then add 1. $$\displaylines{19 =\\ 00010011\\
11101100 \\
11101101}$$
