### **Somerset v. Stewart (1772) — Slavery and the Law**

- **Overview**: A landmark British case that raised early questions about slavery, rights, and what it means to be legally recognized as a person.
    
- **Facts**: Somerset, an enslaved African man, was brought from Massachusetts to England by his enslaver, Stewart. He escaped, was recaptured, and was to be shipped to Jamaica and sold.
    
- **Legal Action**: Somerset’s godparents (abolitionists) sought a **writ of habeas corpus**, arguing that slavery had no legal basis in England.
    
- **Decision**: Lord Mansfield ruled that **no one could be forcibly removed from England as a slave**, because slavery was not supported by English **positive law**.
    
- **Significance**:
    - The case did **not abolish slavery** in the British Empire, but it was a major step in limiting it within England.
    - Highlighted how **law can both support and challenge systems like slavery**, depending on how it's interpreted.
    - Raised foundational questions about **human rights and legal personhood**.

### **Pierre Trudeau on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982)**

- **Context**: Trudeau led the **patriation of Canada’s Constitution**, severing the final legal ties with Britain.
    
- **View of Rights**: He believed in a **liberal vision of human rights**, where each person has inherent **dignity, value, and equality**.
    
- **Universalism**: Rights should transcend “accidents of place and time,” applying to **all people** as part of universal humanity.
    
- **Significance**: The Charter reflects this belief—making rights constitutional and harder for governments to override.

### **Justice L’Heureux-Dubé on Gender Equality in Canada**

- **Edwards v. Canada (1929) – The “Persons Case”**:
    - Women were **finally recognized as “persons”** eligible for Senate appointment.
    - But the decision was based on a **lack of law explicitly excluding women**, not on a principle of equality.
        
- **1960 Bill of Rights**:
    - Canada’s **first written statement of rights**.
    - **Critique**: Interpreted narrowly by courts; lacked real enforcement power.
        
- **1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms**:
    - Seen by L’Heureux-Dubé as a **major leap forward** for gender equality.
    - Women’s groups lobbied for:
        1. **Broad equality language**.
        2. **Strict scrutiny for sex-based distinctions**.
        3. **A specific gender equality clause**.
            
- **Section 15**: Guarantees equality and includes **sex** explicitly.
    
- **Section 28**: Guarantees all Charter rights **equally to men and women**, without exception.
    
- **Legacy**: Groups like **LEAF** (Women’s Legal Education and Action Fund) have played a key role in **shaping how courts interpret equality rights**.
    
- **Caution**: The idea of “equality” is **contested and complex**, but this complexity is why continued activism and vigilance are needed.
