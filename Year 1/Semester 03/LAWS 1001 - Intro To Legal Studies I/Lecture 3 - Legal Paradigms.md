##### Legal Positivism: Core Ideas

 **1. Law as a Creation of the State**
- Law is always created and established by the **state**.
- Law’s existence and authority depend on the **power and authority of the state**.

 **2. Law as Autonomous**
- Law should be understood **on its own terms**, as a distinct body of rules.
- It is **independent from morality, politics, economics**, or other social norms.
- There is **no inherent connection** between law and morality.

**3. Rejection of Natural Law**
- Legal positivists **reject natural law theory**.
- Natural law holds that law must be grounded in **objective moral principles**.
- Positivists argue that a law doesn’t have to be morally justified to be legally valid.

**4. Law as a Rational System**
- Many legal positivists view law as a **closed, rationally integrated system**.
- Hans Kelsen is a key figure advocating this view, emphasizing law as a logical, self-contained system.

##### Legal Realism: Key Points

**1. Rejection of Autonomous Legal Actors**
- Legal realists reject the idea that law involves self-standing, autonomous actors with clear, singular “wills.”
- Real people and social conditions are far more complex and messy than traditional legal theory assumes.

**2. Rejection of Law as a Natural Order**
- They deny that law is a natural order reflecting how society “naturally” is or ought to be.
- Law is not fixed or naturally given.

**3. Concept of Indeterminacy**
- Law and legal reasoning are **never fully determinate** (i.e., they don’t always produce predictable, consistent outcomes).
- Legal decisions are not mechanical or purely logical but open to interpretation.

**4. Influence of Judges’ Backgrounds**
- Judges’ socio-economic backgrounds, political beliefs, and personal experiences influence their interpretation and application of the law.

 **5. Empirical and Pragmatic Approach**
- Legal realists emphasize **empirical social-scientific study** of how judges, juries, and legal actors behave in practice.
- They favour **pragmatic assessments** focused on the real-world costs and benefits of laws, policies, and dispute resolution methods.

##### Marxist Approaches to Law: Key Points

 1. **Law as a Product of Socio-Economic Forces**
- Marxists view legal rules (like morals, culture, political systems, and state institutions) as **products** of deeper socio-economic forces.
- These economic relations drive history and shape society more fundamentally than law itself.

 2. **Skepticism About Law as a Tool for Change**
- Real progress isn’t achieved primarily through legal reforms or legal arguments.
- Instead, it occurs through **concrete changes** in social and economic relationships (e.g., changes in class relations).

 3. **Law and State as Tools for Class Power**
- The ruling class uses the state and its legal system to maintain and justify its power.
- The law helps secure **legitimacy** for ruling class authority.
- Coercion alone isn’t enough; law (and ideology generally) helps make domination appear acceptable or “legitimate.”

##### **Weberian Approaches to Law: Key Points**

 1. **Classification of Law Types**
- Weber identifies different types of law:
    - **Formal vs. Informal**
    - **Modern vs. Traditional**
    - **Rational vs. Irrational**

 2. **Modern Law as Formal and Rational**
- Modern legal systems are characterized by:
    - **Formal rules** that are stable and consistent.
    - **Rational application** of law—legal decisions follow established rules rather than arbitrary moral or political goals.
    - Law is **predictable** and rule-governed.
- This sets modern law apart from systems based on ethics, religion, or politics.

 3. **Relationship Between Law and Capitalism**
- Weber links the development of modern law closely to the growth of **capitalism** in Europe starting in the 16th century.
- Unlike Marx, who sees law as an outcome of capitalism, **Weber argues capitalism emerged partly because of the modern legal-rational order** and cultural forces like the Protestant work ethic.
- Law and capitalism thus have a **mutually reinforcing** relationship in Weber’s view.

##### **Feminist Legal Theory, Queer Legal Theory, and Critical Race Theory**

 1. **Feminist Legal Theory**
- Focuses on how law **sanctions domination and exploitation** that subordinate women.
- Aims for **concrete social change** (e.g., recognizing unpaid care work as real work).
- Has laid the groundwork for **queer legal theory**.

 2. **Queer Legal Theory**
- Concerns legal issues related to **LGBTQ+ communities**, including the rights of transgender persons.
- Builds on feminist legal theory’s foundation.

 3. **Critical Race Theory**
- Explores how people come to be associated with **racial identities**.
- Questions assumptions about race.
- Reveals the role of race in **law-making and law enforcement**.
- Seeks the **emancipation** of those subordinated due to race.

 4. **Intersectionality**
- Recognizes that identities are **complex and overlapping**.
- A person is not just one identity (e.g., woman, homosexual, or person of color) but can embody **multiple identities simultaneously**.
- This complexity affects how legal and social issues are experienced and must be addressed
