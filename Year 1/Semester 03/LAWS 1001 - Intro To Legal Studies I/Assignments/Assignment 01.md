In the 1989 article 'Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex', Kimberlé Crenshaw 
discusses the issue of the lack of nuance in law, politics, and academic study around any individual. She examines how the current frameworks used in these areas can often fail to consider the people who live at the intersection of more than one form of marginalization. In particular, Crenshaw focuses on how Black women are, more or less, marginalized in anti-discrimination law, feminist theory, and antiracist politics. This happens because these systems have a tendency to look at identity through only one category at a time, such as race or gender, but not both together.

Crenshaw argues the importance of this issue because ignoring the intersectional experiences of individuals allows flawed systems to continue operating without offering fair treatment to all. She puts forth that systems meant to fight discrimination exclude those most affected when they ignore the complexity of overlapping identities. The purpose of her article is to introduce the concept of intersectionality with the goal of integrating it into the existing legal framework.

The core thesis of Crenshaw's article is that current approaches to discrimination are flawed because they fail to account for intersectionality. She introduces the concept of intersectionality to explain how individuals are often judged based on a single aspect of their identity rather than being understood as a whole. Crenshaw highlights how Black women are marginalized in both feminist and antiracist movements, which tend to centre around the experiences of white women and Black men, respectively.

Crenshaw argues that our legal system handles discrimination using a "single-axis" approach that treats race and gender as completely separate issues. This creates a major problem for Black women facing discrimination based on both their race and gender, as the systems currently in place aren't nuanced enough to act upon this issue while accounting for the intersectionality of these two characteristics.

Crenshaw backs up her argument using a mix of real court cases, theory, and everyday situations. She discusses cases like _DeGraffenreid_, _Moore v. Hughes Helicopters_, and _Payne v. Travenol_ to show how the legal system fails to deal with discrimination that affects people in more than one way. These examples show how Black women can end up ignored by laws that only look at race or gender, not both. Crenshaw also points out that feminist movements often focus mostly on white women, and antiracist movements usually focus on Black men. Because of that, Black women's specific problems often get left out by both sides.

The evidence Crenshaw uses becomes much more convincing when she brings in real court cases to show how the legal system misses intersectional discrimination. Her points are also backed up by how she looks at activism and theory that claim to be inclusive but end up leaving people out. Crenshaw points out the problems in the system and also offers intersectionality as a way to address them.

With that being said, there are several counter-arguments to Crenshaw's thesis. While there are many opposing views, there are three that Crenshaw focuses on more closely. One argument is that adding intersectional categories to the legal system could make it overly complex and harder to manage. Another concern is that overlapping identities might lead to debates about which group experiences the most discrimination. Lastly, the concern that our current system already has these parameters in place and that they are not being applied appropriately to account for intersectionality. 

Crenshaw acknowledges the opposing views and argues that the simplicity of the 'single-axis' framework reinforces the status quo. She also reinforces that her suggestion is to elevate our current system to allow for a more nuanced approach discrimination in law by integrating intersectionality. She also emphasizes that ignoring the issues put forth by her article for the sake of simplicity in law compromises the system itself and that the more complex approach can make the system stronger and more effective.

In conclusion, Crenshaw’s _“Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex”_ offers a potential path forward in improving how the legal system approaches discrimination. Intersectionality allows for a more complete understanding of individuals by recognizing the overlap of multiple marginalized identities. This idea put forth by Crenshaw helps to create a fairer and more inclusive framework for all, but more specifically, those affected by the system the most.
