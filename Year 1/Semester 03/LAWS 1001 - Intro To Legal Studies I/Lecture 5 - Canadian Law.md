##### Reference re Secession of Québec (1998)

- **Unwritten Constitutional Principles:**
    - The Court emphasized that Canada’s Constitution is not limited to just the written documents (such as the Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982).
    - It also includes important **unwritten principles** like **federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and the protection of minorities**.
    - These principles help interpret and guide the application of the written Constitution and fill in gaps where the text may be silent.
        
- **Living Tree Doctrine:**
    - Canadian constitutional law is often described as a “living tree,” a metaphor originally from an earlier case (Edwards v. Canada, 1930).
    - This means the Constitution is a dynamic document capable of evolving to reflect changing social, political, and economic realities.
    - The “living tree” approach allows courts to interpret the Constitution in a way that keeps it relevant and adaptable over time.

- **Implications for Secession:**
    - The SCC ruled that Québec does **not have a unilateral right to secede** under Canadian constitutional law.
    - Any secession would have to follow the democratic process and constitutional framework, respecting both the **written** and **unwritten principles**.
    - For example, respect for federalism requires negotiation with the rest of Canada, and democracy requires that such a move have clear support from Québecers.
        
- **Historical and Contextual Understanding:**
    - The Constitution is seen as a product of history and political development.
    - This history informs the interpretation of both its written text and unwritten principles, giving depth and context to constitutional rules.
