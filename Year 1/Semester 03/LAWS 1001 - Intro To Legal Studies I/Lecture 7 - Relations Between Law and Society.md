### **Mirror Theory of Law and Society**

- **Summary**: This theory suggests that law is a direct reflection of the society in which it exists—it “mirrors” the social, economic, political, and cultural conditions of its time.
    
- **Key Idea**: Law gains its legitimacy and effectiveness by aligning with prevailing social norms and values, which reduces the need for enforcement.
    
- **Critique**: Reality is more complex—formal state law often fails to fully capture or represent actual social relations. Social life can evolve faster or differently than the law.

### **Legal Pluralism**

- **Summary**: Legal pluralism holds that law is not only created by the state—many forms of law exist independently, created by different groups in society.
    
- **Key Idea**: Non-state law (like church law or merchant law) operates alongside state law and can also maintain social order.
    
- **Critique**: If any social norm that maintains order can be considered “law,” it becomes hard to distinguish between what is truly legal and what is just a norm or custom.

### **Institutionalized Normative Order**

- **Summary**: This view defines law as a special type of social order that is maintained by institutions (like courts, police, legislatures) which have the power to enforce rules.
    
- **Key Idea**: What makes a system “legal” is the presence of organized institutions capable of applying coercion to enforce norms.
    
- **Critique**: This theory struggles to explain legal systems (like many Indigenous legal orders) that function without centralized state-like institutions yet are clearly legal systems.

### **Relative Autonomy Thesis**

- **Summary**: Law has its own internal structure, logic, and language that makes it distinct from other social systems, but it is not completely independent from society.
    
- **Key Idea**: Legal professionals, legal reasoning, and legal institutions have unique qualities (like legal jargon and specific procedures) that give law a degree of autonomy.
    
- **Critique**: The theory can overstate law’s independence—law is still heavily influenced by social values, power structures, and outside forces.

### **Tamanaha’s Realistic Approach**

- **Summary**: Brian Tamanaha argues that law should be studied as a changing social institution, shaped by and shaping society in return.
    
- **Key Idea**: Law develops alongside historical, cultural, political, and technological changes. This “realistic” view avoids abstract or overly formal definitions of law.
    
- **Application**: Tamanaha uses this approach to critique legal education (especially in the U.S.), arguing that law schools often ignore the real-world context in which law operates.
