##### Law is distinguished by distinct and readily identifiable forms

The essence of law lies in its adherence to structured and universally recognized procedures. For any rule or principle to qualify as "law," it must be created, communicated, interpreted, applied, and enforced according to formal protocols that are widely accepted as legitimate within a society. 

These protocols, essential to the concept of law, ensure that a rule is considered legally valid only if it complies with established legal procedures. Despite varying interpretations across legal systems, the concept of legal form remains fundamental, defining what constitutes law regardless of the specific legal framework or perspective.

##### Law is a language

To make a legal argument is to use a specific set of terms and expressions.

Like any other language, law has a distinct grammar, a distinct (and often highly technical) vocabulary, distinct styles and patterns of argumentation, and distinct maxims, idioms, shorthand expressions, and proverbial “wise old sayings”.

##### Law is informed by substantive principles

A classic list of principles is the one provided by Lon Fuller, a famous mid-twentieth-century  
legal scholar, in a 1964 book entitled *The Morality of Law*:  
	1. There must be laws (i.e. it is not sufficient for one or another ruler, say, to make random decisions; laws must be available)  
	2. Laws must be publicized  
	3. Laws cannot be retroactive (i.e. laws should not to be applied to incidents that occurred before the law itself was available)  
	4. Laws must be understandable  
	5. Laws must not contradict each other  
	6. Laws must not require the impossible  
	7. Laws must not change too rapidly  
	8. Laws must be enforced

##### Law is both general and specific

- **General:** Legal rules are usually framed to apply broadly to all people in similar situations (e.g., anyone entering a contract), regardless of personal characteristics like race or gender. This supports fairness and equality.

- **Specific:** These rules apply only to people in particular circumstances (e.g., those involved in a contract), not to everyone at all times.

- While generality promotes equal application, it may overlook the real-life power dynamics in society.

##### Law is Normative

- Legal rules are **normative**, meaning they tell us how people **ought** to behave, rather than just describing what people do.

- This contrasts with **factual statements**, which simply describe reality without prescribing behaviour.

- When law has **normative force**, it sets a **standard** for how people should act, shaping and guiding social behaviour.

- Not all norms are legal—some social norms (like not breaking up over the phone) may guide behaviour but aren’t enforceable by law.

##### Law both reflects and shapes social relations.

- **Reflective role:** Law mirrors existing social relationships—it represents the way society is currently organized.

- **Constitutive role:** Law also **shapes and transforms** those relationships, actively influencing how society functions.

- This **constitutive power** means law can define what behaviours are allowed or forbidden, helping to structure social interactions.

- However, because of this power, law can also contribute to injustice and inequality in society.

##### Law is authoritative.

- Law derives its authority from enforcement mechanisms, often backed by powerful institutions like **courts, tribunals, and police**.

- However, law’s authority isn’t only about **coercion**; it can also come from a **sense of duty, habit, or moral obligation**.

- People often follow the law (e.g., stopping at a red light) not out of fear, but because they believe it’s the **right or socially responsible** thing to do.

- Different societies have various **dispute-resolution systems** that carry **normative authority**, and these systems are also considered forms of law.
