##### Law is distinguished by distinct and readily identifiable forms

The essence of law lies in its adherence to structured and universally recognized procedures. For any rule or principle to qualify as "law," it must be created, communicated, interpreted, applied, and enforced according to formal protocols that are widely accepted as legitimate within a society. 

These protocols, essential to the concept of law, ensure that a rule is considered legally valid only if it complies with established legal procedures. Despite varying interpretations across legal systems, the concept of legal form remains fundamental, defining what constitutes law regardless of the specific legal framework or perspective.

##### Law is a language

To make a legal argument is to use a specific set of terms and expressions.

Like any other language, law has a distinct grammar, a distinct (and often highly technical) vocabulary, distinct styles and patterns of argumentation, and distinct maxims, idioms, shorthand expressions, and proverbial “wise old sayings”.

##### Law is informed by substantive principles

A classic list of principles is the one provided by Lon Fuller, a famous mid-twentieth-century  
legal scholar, in a 1964 book entitled *The Morality of Law*:  
	1. There must be laws (i.e. it is not sufficient for one or another ruler, say, to make random decisions; laws must be available)  
	2. Laws must be publicized  
	3. Laws cannot be retroactive (i.e. laws should not to be applied to incidents that occurred before the law itself was available)  
	4. Laws must be understandable  
	5. Laws must not contradict each other  
	6. Laws must not require the impossible  
	7. Laws must not change too rapidly  
	8. Laws must be enforced

##### Law is both general and specific
