##### Substantive and Procedural Law

- **Substantive law** defines **rights and duties**—it tells us what people are **entitled to** or **obligated to do**.

- **Procedural law** sets out the **processes** for enforcing those rights and duties—like how someone is **arrested, tried, or can appeal** a verdict.

- In short: substantive law is about **what** the law is, and procedural law is about **how** the law is applied.

##### Public and Private Law

- **Private law** governs relationships between **private individuals or entities** (e.g., contracts, torts, property, family law).

- **Public law** governs relationships between **individuals and the state** (e.g., criminal law, constitutional law, administrative law, tax law).

- While this distinction is useful, some areas of law—like **labour or competition law**—can have both **private and public aspects**, depending on the context.

### **Indigenous Law: Key Concepts**

 **1. Legal Personality of the Earth**
- **Indigenous traditions** (e.g., **Anishinabek law**) view the **Earth as sentient**—as having **legal personality**.
- This contrasts with Western legal traditions, which typically **do not recognize the land as a legal subject**.
    
> **Quote from John Borrows:**  
> “The land’s sentience is a fundamental principle of Anishinabek law... They developed law to direct behaviour towards a more peaceful, orderly, and respectful future.”


 **2. Property and Ownership**
- **Western legal systems** (common law and civil law) emphasize **ownership**: rights to use, sell, or exploit land.
- **Indigenous legal traditions** emphasize **responsibility** and **care** over **control**:
    - Land is **not "owned" absolutely**.
    - It is **held in trust** for the benefit of **future generations**.
    - Emphasis is on **stewardship** rather than **dominion**.

> **Quote from Borrows:**  
> “Land does not ultimately belong to a person... land is provisionally held for contemporary sustenance and for those unborn.”


 **Implications**
- **Legal conflict** can arise when Indigenous legal perspectives clash with Canadian statutory or case law, especially in matters of land use and resource development.
- Recognizing **Indigenous legal traditions** means **rethinking foundational legal concepts** like ownership, personhood, and sovereignty.

##### **Common Law: Key Concepts**

 **1. Definition and Source**
- **Common law** is a **legal tradition** grounded primarily in **court judgments**.
- Though **statutes** (laws passed by legislatures) matter, **judicial decisions** are central.
- Common law is part of Ontario’s legal system, as well as most of Canada and other English-speaking countries.

**2. Precedent and Stare Decisis**
- **Precedent**: Past court decisions influence future cases.
- **Stare decisis**: Latin for “to stand by things decided”—the principle that similar cases should be decided in similar ways.
- Higher court rulings are **binding** on lower courts in the same jurisdiction.

**3. Role of Legal Professionals**
- **Lawyers**: Interpret and apply case law to advocate for clients.
- **Judges**: Interpret case law and ensure consistent application.

 **4. Historical Background**
- Originated in **late medieval Britain**.
- Spread through **British colonialism**, forming the basis of law in many countries (e.g., Canada, Australia, India).

 **Implications**
- Understanding **case law** is essential to practicing law in a common law system.
- Legal reasoning often involves comparing a current case with **precedents** to determine outcomes.
- The system emphasizes **continuity** and **consistency** in legal decision-making.

##### **Civil Law: Key Features**

 **1. Definition and Source**
- Civil law relies heavily on **legal codes** — detailed, comprehensive manuals or digests of laws.
- These codes **systematize rules and principles** in a logical and organized manner.
- Courts **interpret and apply** these codes rather than create law.

 **2. Role of Judges**
- Judges in civil law systems are **appliers of the law**, not creators.
- The **legislative branch** holds the primary lawmaking authority.
- There is **less emphasis on judicial decisions** shaping the law compared to common law.

 **3. Precedent**
- Civil law systems **do not follow strict precedent** (stare decisis).
- Courts are **not bound** by prior decisions of other courts or even their own past rulings.

 **4. Geographic and Historical Context**
- Civil law is the **dominant legal tradition worldwide**.
- It is used primarily in:
    - **Continental Europe** (e.g., France, Germany)
    - **Latin America**
    - Many countries in **Asia and Africa** (e.g., Angola, China, Lebanon, Mozambique, Turkey).

- Its spread is linked to **colonial influence** by countries like France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, etc.

**Comparison with Common Law**
- Common law: Law develops mainly through **judicial decisions** (precedents).
- Civil law: Law is primarily from **statutory codes**, with judges applying these rules.
- Precedent is **binding in common law**, but **not strictly followed in civil law**.
