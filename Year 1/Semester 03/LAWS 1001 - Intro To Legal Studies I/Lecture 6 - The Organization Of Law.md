##### Role of Legislatures
- **Legislatures make laws** — these laws are later interpreted and applied by courts.
- In Canada, law-making powers are **divided between federal and provincial legislatures** due to federalism.


 **Distribution of Law-Making Powers**
- The division of powers is set out primarily in **Sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867**.


**Federal Government (Parliament: House of Commons + Senate)**
Has jurisdiction over areas including:
- Criminal law
- Copyright law
- Currency
- Military and defense
- Postal services
- Inter-provincial navigation and transportation
- Banking
- Certain matters involving Indigenous peoples


**Provincial Governments**
Have jurisdiction over areas including:
- Health care and public health
- Education systems
- Marriage (except divorce, which is federal)
- Municipal institutions
- Property and civil rights **within the province** (contracts, torts, etc.)
- Administration of justice via **provincial courts**

##### Administrative Bodies

 **What Are Administrative Bodies?**
- **Administrative bodies** are boards, tribunals, or agencies created by federal or provincial **legislation**.
- They are granted **decision-making power** over specific areas (e.g., employment, broadcasting, human rights).
- Often hold **quasi-judicial powers** — they can conduct hearings, make rulings, and issue orders.


**Legal Framework and Accountability**
- Administrative bodies must:
    - Follow **Canadian law**, including the **Charter of Rights and Freedoms**
    - Respect **procedural fairness** (e.g., fair hearings, unbiased decision-makers)
- **Court oversight:**
    - Their decisions may be **reviewed by courts** for legal errors or unfair processes.
    - Courts can **quash** (cancel) a decision and send it back for reconsideration.


 **Key Federal Administrative Bodies**
- **Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB)** – labour relations and union disputes
- **Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC)** – discrimination complaints
- **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** – broadcasting and telecom regulation
- **Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB)** – immigration, asylum, and refugee decisions
- **Privacy Commissioner of Canada** – oversight of personal data handling


**Key Provincial Administrative Bodies (e.g., Ontario)**
- **Environmental Assessment and Appeal Boards** – review environmental impacts
- **Ontario Human Rights Commission** – addresses discrimination and equality
- **Ontario Securities Commission (OSC)** – regulates financial markets and securities
- **Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB)** – workplace injury compensation
- **Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal (WSIAT)** – hears appeals of WSIB decisions

##### Precedent (Stare Decisis)

 **What Is Precedent (Stare Decisis)?**
- **Precedent** means that decisions made by courts—especially higher courts—can have **binding authority** on **future cases**.
- The principle of **stare decisis** ensures that **legal rules** set by one court are followed by **other courts**, especially those **lower** in the court hierarchy.


 **Purpose of Precedent**
- Promotes **consistency** and **predictability** in legal decisions.
- Reinforces the **rule of law** by ensuring similar cases are treated similarly.
- Helps guide lawyers, judges, and the public on how the law will be applied.


 **Precedent in Practice**
- **Higher appellate courts** (e.g., **Supreme Court of Canada**) create the most influential precedents.
- **Lower courts** are generally **bound** to follow decisions from higher courts in the same jurisdiction.
- **Appellate courts**, including the Supreme Court, typically try to follow their own past decisions for consistency.
    - **However**, they are **not strictly bound** to do so.
    - For example, the **Supreme Court of Canada** used to apply strict precedent to its own rulings but **no longer does**.


**Key Takeaways**
- **Hierarchy matters**: the higher the court, the more authoritative its decisions.
- Precedent adds **stability** to the legal system but allows **flexibility** for top courts to adapt or reverse earlier decisions as needed.

##### Statutory Interpretation

**What Is Statutory Interpretation?**
- Statutory interpretation refers to the **methods** or **tools** used by judges, lawyers, and others to **understand and apply legislation**.
- It's like a **toolbox**: different interpretive techniques (called **canons**) are used depending on the legal issue and context.


**Key Interpretive Approaches**
1. **Plain Meaning Rule**
	- Focuses on the **literal wording** of the statute.
	- Courts attempt to apply the law based on what the words **ordinarily mean**.
	- Challenge: What counts as “plain” is often **disputed**.

 2. **Purposive (Liberal) Interpretation**
	- Courts look beyond literal meaning to determine the **purpose** or **intent** of the legislation.
	- Focus is on **fair, large, and liberal construction** to fulfill the **true meaning and spirit** of the law.


 **The Rizzo Case (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd.)**
- **Ontario Court of Appeal** used the **plain meaning** of the Employment Standards Act to decide the case.
- **Supreme Court of Canada** overturned that decision, calling the plain meaning approach **overly restrictive**.
- SCC endorsed a **purposive approach**, saying interpretation must align with the **object and intent** of the Act.

 **Key Takeaways**
- No single interpretive method is **foolproof** or **always preferred**.
- Courts must use **context**, **purpose**, and **legislative intent** alongside the text.
- Rizzo demonstrates how courts may **disagree** on which interpretation method to apply.
