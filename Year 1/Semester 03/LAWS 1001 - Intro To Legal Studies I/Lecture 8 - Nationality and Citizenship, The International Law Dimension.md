#### **Two Basic Principles of Nationality in International Law:**

##### 1. **Jus soli** – _“Law of the soil”_
- **Meaning**: A person gains nationality or citizenship by being born **on the territory** of a state.
- **Also known as**: **Birthright citizenship**.
- **Includes**: Birth on land, as well as on state-registered ships or aircraft.
- **Main feature**: Focuses on **place of birth**.

##### 2. **Jus sanguinis** – _“Law of the blood”_
- **Meaning**: A person gains nationality through **parental descent**, regardless of where they are born.
- **Main feature**: Focuses on **bloodline/ancestry**, not place of birth.

#### **Most Countries Use a Mix**

- Some states apply only **one** of these principles, but **many (like Canada)** use a **combination of both**.
- These mixed or **hybrid regimes** determine nationality by **both place of birth and parentage**.

#### **Extra Note:**

- **Birthright citizenship (jus soli)** is **most fully recognized** in countries like **the United States and Canada**, where being born on the territory almost always guarantees citizenship, with few exceptions (e.g., children of diplomats).
