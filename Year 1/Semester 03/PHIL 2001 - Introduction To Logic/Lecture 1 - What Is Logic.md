Logic is the study of correct reasoning. The main building blocks of reasoning are ARGUMENTS.

##### Arguments
An argument is a set of propositions (sentences that can be either true or false), in which one – called the “CONCLUSION” – is set up to be supported by, or to follow from, the others – called the “PREMISES”.  
	• The premises are said to give evidence for, or to lead to, the conclusion.

| inasmuch as          |     | thus                  |
| may be inferred from |     | ergo                  |
| owing to             |     | we may conclude       |
| seeing that          |     | we may infer          |
| since (non-temporal) |     | whence                |

|                      |     | which proves that     |
|                      |     | which shows that      |

#### Types Of Arguments

##### Deductive
• The conclusion claims to follow from the premises with CERTAINTY.  
• Can be either VALID (correct) or INVALID (incorrect) – there’s no middle ground!  
• The state of affairs in the world does NOT influence its validity, which depends only on the internal STRUCTURE of the argument.

**Example Sentences :**
	Fish are not mammals, but dolphins are. So, no dolphins are fish.  
	Dogs are smarter than cats, since it is easier to  train them.  
	If she were still interested in me, she would have called, but she didn’t.


##### Inductive
• The conclusion follows from the premises with various degrees of PROBABILITY.  
• Can have varying degrees of STRENGTH or WEAKNESS – it’s a sliding scale.  
• Information about the state of affairs in the world MAY affect its strength, which depends on its CONTENT (what it talks about).

**Example Sentences :**
	I’ve never met a golden retriever with a nasty disposition. I bet there aren’t any.  
	When blue jays are breeding, they become aggressive. Consequently, scrub jays, which are very similar to blue jays, can also be expected to be aggressive when they’re breeding.  
	That cat is used to dogs. Probably she won’t be upset if you bring home a new dog for a pet.

#### Validity And Truth

A VALID argument is an argument which CANNOT have all true premises and false conclusion. An INVALID argument CAN (but does not necessarily) have all true premises and false conclusion.


|     | <center>Valid<br>All A are B; all B are C.  <br>So, all A are C</center>                                          | <center>Invalid<br>If A, then B; B. So, A</center><br>                                                |

| TT  | All narwhals are  <br>whales; all whales are  <br>mammals. So, all  <br>narwhals are mammals.  <br>SOUND ARGUMENT | If you are in Ottawa,  <br>you are in Ontario; you  <br>are in Ontario. So, you  <br>are in Ottawa.   |
| TF  | X                                                                                                                 | If you are in Toronto,  <br>you are in Ontario; you  <br>are in Ontario. So, you  <br>are in Toronto. |
| FT  | All whales are birds ;all  <br>birds are mammals. So,  <br>all whales are mammals                                 | If you are in Ottawa,  <br>you are in Toronto; you  <br>are in Toronto. So, you  <br>are in Ottawa.   |
| FF  | All whales are birds; all  <br>birds are penguins. So,  <br>all whales are penguins.                              | If you are in Toronto,  <br>you are in Alberta; you  <br>are in Alberta. So, you  <br>are in Toronto. |
