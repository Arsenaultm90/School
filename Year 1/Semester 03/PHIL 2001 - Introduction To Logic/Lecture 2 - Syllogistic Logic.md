Syllogistic logic investigates the relationships among categories of things (or individual  
things) in order to establish the validity of arguments.

##### Categories
Use CAPITAL letters  
Examples: “students” = S, “benches” = B , “games”= G
How to identify: more than one thing can respond to that description at any given time,  
in that specific context.  
Example: “person in this room with a pet alligator” = A.  
Usually introduced by “a”, adjectives, verbs

##### Individual Things
Use SMALLCAP letters  
Examples: “Elisabeta” = e, “the first wheel” = w, “the idea of God” = i
How to identify: only one thing can respond to that description at any given time,  
in that specific context.  
Example: “the Canadian Prime Minister” = c.  
Usually introduced by “the”, “this”, “that”, proper names

#### Anatomy Of A Categorical Sentence

**Some A is not B**
2 terms (either categories or individual things): 1st = the  
subject; 2nd = the predicate.  
Copula between the terms: is /are (not).  
Quantity indicator: All, No, Some. 

Well formed formulas (wffs) in categorical (syllogistic) logic:

| **All A is B** | **No A is B**  | **Some A is B** | **Some A is Not B** |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **a is B**     | **a is not B** | **a is b**      | **a is not B**      |

#### Testing For Validity

**Distribution**
Underline everything that is after a negation (“no”, “not”).  
Underline the first term right after “all”
Underline the second term after "is not"

**Starring**
Star everything that is underlined in the premises.  
Star everything that is NOT underlined in the conclusion.

**Validity**
Exactly 1 star on the right.
Every CAPITAL letter starred exactly once.

Example (Valid) :
	All <u>A</u>* is B
	c is not <u>B</u>*
	∴ c* is not <u>A</u>

#### Contradictories

Pairs of contradictories cannot be both true at the same time, and they cannot be both false at the same time.  
They always have different truth values: if we know one is true, the other one must be false, and if we know that one is false, the other one must be true.  
Each pair of contradictories has exactly ONE negation (“no”, “not”) and, if there are quantifiers, exactly ONE “some”.

a is B / a is not B  
a is b / a is not b  
all A is B / some A isn’t B  
no A is B / some A is B

**Examples :**
You are biking / You aren’t biking.  
He is my father/He isn’t my father.  
All students are Ontarians /Some students aren’t Ontarians.  
No swan is pink / Some swans are  
pink.

#### Idiomatic Arguments

Entirely in English, with no logical symbols in them; they look just like a passage from any book.

Only rational people are students. This means that not all intelligent people are enrolled in  
this course, since there are some intelligent people that aren’t rational.

#### Venn Diagram Methods

1. A shadowed area means EMPTY, and an x in an area means NON-EMPTY.  
2. Never draw the conclusion in your diagram.  
3. First draw the universal premise (All, No), before the particular premise (Some, Some not).  
4. In an argument diagram, every premise occupies 2 areas.  
5. When the conclusion requires 2 ‘x’s, the one that counts is the one that makes the conclusion FALSE. Circle that one!
