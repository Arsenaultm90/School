#### Basic Notions  

**Proposition** 
	Unit that has a truth value (either true or false)  
**Argument** 
	Set of propositions, in which one (the conclusion) is given as the main idea, and as supported by the others (the premises)  
**Valid argument** 
	An argument that cannot have all premises true and the conclusion false  
**Invalid argument** 
	An argument that can (but doesn’t necessarily) have all premises true and the conclusion false  
**Sound argument** 
	A valid argument with all premises true

#### Syllogistic Logic  

**Translation tips**  
Small Letters = uniquely identifiable things – only one thing can respond to the description at a given time, in the given context.
Big Letters = groups of things – more than one thing can respond to the description at the same time, in the given context.

All translated sentences have to fit into one of these 8 forms:

| **a is B**     | **a is b**     | **All A is B**  | **No A is B**       |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **a is not B** | **a is not b** | **Some A is B** | **Some A is not B** |

**Some common tricky translations :**
- Only A is B = All B is A  
- None but A's are B's = All B is A  
- A's are B's = All A is B  
- Not all A's are B's = Some A is not B  
- All A's aren't B's = No A is B  
- Nothing is A unless it’s B = All A is B  
- Something isn’t A unless it’s B = All A is B  
- All A's are non-B's = No A is B  
- A's aren’t B's = No A is B  
- If something is A, it is B = All A is B

**Testing for validity**  
1. Underline the one term after “all” and all the terms after “no” or “not”  
2. Star all the underlined terms in the premises and all the terms that are not underlined in the conclusion  
3. There must be exactly one starred term on the right, and every capital letter must be starred exactly once. If an argument verifies both of these conditions, it is valid; if it fails either of them, it is invalid

**Finding implicit elements (premises or conclusions)**  
1. Always look for the implicit premise that makes the argument valid.  
2. In a syllogism, every term must appear exactly twice.

**Venn diagrams**  
Only applicable to classic syllogisms (3 terms exactly, all capital letters)  
Draw the two premises in the master diagram, which should look like this:  
Never draw the conclusion in the master diagram!  

Draw each of the premises in the master diagram, keeping an eye on the appropriate circles, according to the following guidelines:

After you draw the premises, if the conclusion is already definitely there, then the argument is valid; if the conclusion isn’t there, or only possibly there, then the argument is invalid.  

After you draw both premises, if you are left with two ‘x’s, the one that is important is the one that makes the conclusion false. You can either erase the other one, or leave both of them in and circle this important one.
