Binary Trees

#### Graphs
Graphs represent relationships between objects with vertices (nodes) connected by edges.

**Types**
- **Directed**: Edges have direction
- **Undirected**: Edges have no direction
- **Weighted**: Edges have associated values/costs
- **Cyclic/Acyclic**: Presence/absence of cycles

**Representations**
- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array where matrix[i][j] indicates edge between i and j
- **Adjacency List**: Array of lists, each list contains neighbors of a vertex

**Graph Algorithms**
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search): Level-by-level traversal
- **DFS** (Depth-First Search): Explores as far as possible along branches
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths from source to all vertices
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Connects all vertices with minimum total edge weight
