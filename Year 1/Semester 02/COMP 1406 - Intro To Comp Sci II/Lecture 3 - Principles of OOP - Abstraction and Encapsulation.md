OOP paradigm aims to design code that is –  
• Easier to understand and maintain  
• Modular structure and scalable  
• More robust  
• Reusable  
• In all: more productive  
... especially, when applied to ‘large systems’.

##### Four Principles of OOP

**Abstraction**
	• Abstraction allows us to do more by hiding or reducing the overall complexity of a program.  
	• Programming languages, classes, methods, and variables are all examples of abstraction in practice.

**Encapsulation**
	Encapsulation is a design process. It has two main tasks.  
	1) It ensures states and methods of an object are stored in the right location.  
	2) It prevents unauthorized users from accessing those states/methods using the correct access modifiers.


Inheritance
Polymorphism
