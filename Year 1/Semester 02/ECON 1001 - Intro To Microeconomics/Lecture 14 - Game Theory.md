##### **Game Theory (Definition)**

**Game theory** is the study of how individuals or firms **make decisions in strategic situations**, where the **outcome of one’s choice depends on the choices of others**.

It’s used to analyze **competitive behaviour**, **cooperation**, and **conflict** among rational decision-makers.

##### **Example of Game Theory:**
**Prisoner’s Dilemma**  
Two criminals are arrested. They can either **cooperate** (stay silent) or **betray** the other (confess).
- If both stay silent, they get light sentences.
- If one confesses and the other doesn’t, the confessor goes free and the other gets a heavy sentence.
- If both confess, both get medium sentences.
    

Even though cooperating gives a better combined outcome, each has an incentive to betray—so both often do, leading to a worse result.
