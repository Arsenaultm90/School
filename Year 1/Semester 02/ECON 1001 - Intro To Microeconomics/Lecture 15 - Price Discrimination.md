#### **Price Discrimination**
**Definition :**
	**Price discrimination** is when a seller charges **different prices** to **different consumers** for the **same good or service**, **not based on differences in cost**.

It allows firms to **capture more consumer surplus** and **increase profits** by charging customers based on their **willingness to pay**.


##### **Perfect Price Discrimination (First-Degree)**
**Definition:**  
	The seller charges **each consumer** the **maximum price** they are **willing to pay**. There is **no consumer surplus**—the firm captures all of it.

**Example:**  
A **car dealership** negotiating individually with customers and charging each one a **different price** based on how much they’re willing to pay.

**Key feature:** Requires **complete information** about each buyer's preferences—rare in practice.


##### **Second-Degree Price Discrimination**
**Definition:**  
Prices vary according to the **quantity consumed** or the **product version**, not based on the consumer’s identity.

- **Electricity pricing**: Consumers pay a lower rate per kWh if they use more electricity.
- **Bulk discounts**: "Buy 1 for $5, or 3 for $12"
- **Airline seat classes**: Economy, business, and first-class seats, with different prices and services.

**Key feature:** Consumers self-select into different price categories.


##### **Third-Degree Price Discrimination**
**Definition:**  
The seller charges **different prices to different groups** of consumers based on **observable characteristics** like age, location, or time.

**Example:**
- **Student or senior discounts** at movie theaters.
- **Geographic pricing**: Different prices for the same product in different countries.
- **Rush hour vs. off-peak pricing** on public transit.

**Key feature:** Firm must be able to **segment the market** and prevent **resale between groups**.
