##### Economic Lexicon

**Framing Effects :**
	**Framing effects** in economics refer to how the way information is presented influences people's decisions, even if the underlying facts remain the same.

**Production Possibility Frontier** :
	The **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)** is a curve that shows the maximum possible output combinations of two goods or services an economy can produce, given its available resources and technology. It illustrates the trade-offs and opportunity costs associated with production choices.

**Law of Demand :**
The **law of demand** states that, **ceteris paribus** (all else equal), when the price of a good **increases**, the quantity demanded **decreases**, and when the price **decreases**, the quantity demanded **increases**.

**Law of Supply :**
The **law of supply** states that, **ceteris paribus**, when the price of a good **increases**, the quantity supplied **increases**, and when the price **decreases**, the quantity supplied **decreases**.

##### Supply and Demand
![[Pasted image 20250212122823.png|300]]


**Movement Along A Curve :**
	**Increase in price :**
		Decrease quantity demand. 
		Increase in quantity supplied.
	**Decrease in price :**
		Increase in quantity demanded.
		Decrease in quantity supplied.


**Shifts Of A Curve :**
The **demand curve shifts** when something changes the **overall willingness to buy** at any given price.
	1. Taste/Preferences
	2. Number of Consumers
	3. Price of Related Goods
	4. Income
	5. Expectations

The **supply curve shifts** when something changes the **cost or ability to produce** at any given price.
	1. Price of Resources
	2. Number of Producers
	3. Technology
	4. Taxes & Subsidies
	5. Expectations

##### Market Equilibrium

Quantity Demanded = Quantity Supplied

Market Equilibrium will change with a shift in a demand or supply curve.



---
##### Elasticity

A measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to one of it determinants.

$$\text{Price Elasticity of Demand } = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{Percentage change in price}} = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}$$

$$\text{Price elasticity of supply} = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}$$


**Elastic vs Inelastic Demands**
0 - Perfectly Inelastic
0 - 1 - Inelastic
1 - Unitary Elastic
1 - ∞ - Elastic
∞ - Perfectly Elastic



**Total Revenue**
$$TR = P \times Q$$


**Burden Of Tax** 
- **Elasticity determines the distribution of the tax burden**. The more **inelastic** either demand or supply is, the **greater the burden on that side** (consumers or producers).

- If one side (demand or supply) is more elastic, the other side (less elastic) will bear a **larger share of the tax burden**.

##### Government Policies

**Price Ceiling :** 
	Legal maximum on price. 
	Only binding if it is below market price.

**Price Floor :**
	Legal minimum on price.
	Only binding if it is above market price.


**Quantity Controls/ Regulations**
A legal minimum or maximum that can be sold

**Binding Mandate :**
	Quantity that is greater than the equilibrium quantity.

**Binding Quota :**
	Quantity that is less than the equilibrium quantity.



##### Taxes

**Tax On Buyers** :
	Affects demand
	Shifts demand to the left
	Price and quantity decrease

**Tax On Sellers :**
	Affects supply
	Shifts supply to the left
	Price increase, quantity decrease

**Tax Incidence**$$Q^D = 56 - 4P_{B}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; Q^S = -4+2P_{S}$$
$$\displaylines{t = \text{ tax price} \\P_{B} = P_{S} + t \\
P_{S} = P_{B} - t}$$
