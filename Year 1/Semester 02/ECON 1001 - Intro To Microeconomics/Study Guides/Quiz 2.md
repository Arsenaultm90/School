**Opportunity Cost Principle**
The **opportunity cost principle** states that the true cost of any decision is the next best alternative foregone. In other words, whenever you make a choice, you give up the opportunity to do something else with those same resources (time, money, effort).

**Cost Benefit Principle**
The **cost-benefit principle** states that a decision should be made if the **benefits** of an action exceed or are at least equal to its **costs**. This principle is fundamental in economics, business, and personal decision-making, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.

**Marginal Benefit Principle**
The **marginal benefit principle** states that a decision should be made if the **marginal benefit** (the additional benefit from consuming or producing one more unit) is **greater than or equal to the marginal cost** (the additional cost of that unit).

**The Interdependence Principle**
The **interdependence principle** states that when making a decision, you must consider how your choices are influenced by and affect **four types of interdependencies**:
1. **Your Own Choices** – One decision can affect others you make.
2. **Other People's Choices** – Your decisions are influenced by others' actions.
3. **Markets** – Changes in one market can affect another.
4. **Time** – What happens today affects future decisions.



**Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)**
$$MPL = \frac{\nabla Q}{\nabla L}$$
Change in quantity of product produced over the change in labor forces.


**Marginal Revenue Product of Labor (MRPL)**
$$MRPL = MPL \times P$$
The marginal product of labor times the price of the product.

If MRPL > Wage, then it is worth hiring another worker.

#### Chapter 8 - Gains From Trade and Comparative Advantage

**GAINS FROM TRADE**
Gains from trade refer to the benefits that individuals, firms, or countries achieve when they specialize in producing goods or services where they have a comparative advantage and trade with others. These gains arise because specialization allows for more efficient production, leading to increased output and consumption possibilities beyond what would be feasible in a closed, self-sufficient system.



**COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE**
Helen and Jamie want to figure out how best to assign their household tasks. For now, we’ll focus on just two tasks, cooking and vacuuming. 

Like good economists, they start with the data:
Helen says that she can vacuum their house in 4 hours, or she can make a meal in 2 hours.
Jamie says that vacuuming their house also takes him 4 hours, but it takes him only 1 hour to make a meal.

So how should they assign these tasks?

Absolute advantage tells you who’s best at a task, but not who should do the task.
Comparative advantage is all about opportunity cost.
You should allocate each task to the person who can do it at the lowest opportunity cost.

$$\text{Opportunity cost of a task = } \frac{\text{Hours this task takes}}{\text{Hours required to produce alternative ouput}}$$

**PRICES ARE SIGNALS, INCENTIVES, AND INFORMATION**
**Role One : Price is a signal**
**Price signals** are the information conveyed to consumers and producers through the price of goods and services, helping them make economic decisions. In a market economy, price signals guide the allocation of resources by reflecting changes in supply and demand.

- **When Prices Rise** (Demand ↑ or Supply ↓):
    - Signals **scarcity** or increased demand.
    - Encourages producers to produce more.
    - Discourages consumers from buying as much.
- **When Prices Fall** (Demand ↓ or Supply ↑):
    - Signals **surplus** or decreased demand.
    - Encourages consumers to buy more.
    - Discourages producers from making as much.

**Role Two : Price is an incentive**
A high price is incentive for suppliers to produce more
A high price is inventive for buyers to consume less

**Role Three : A price aggregates information**
In economics, prices serve as a powerful mechanism for aggregating information about supply, demand, scarcity, and consumer preferences. This idea is central to the concept of **efficient markets**, where prices reflect all available information and guide economic decision-making.

#### Chapter 11/12 - Labour Market, Wages, Inequality

**Demand For Labour**
Marginal Benefit = Extra Revenue
Marginal Cost = Wage
Marginal Benefit - Cost = Marginal Profit

Rule For Employers:
	Hire an additional worker if their Marginal Revenue Product is greater than or equal to the wage.  
	That is, hire workers until wage = marginal revenue product.
