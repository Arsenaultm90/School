##### **Total Cost (TC)**
Since ATC = TC / Q → rearrange:
> **TC = ATC × Q**

##### **Fixed Cost**
This is trickier — because FC doesn’t change with quantity. So:
- Find **Total Cost** when **Q = 0 or Q = 1**
- If you have multiple TC values for increasing Q, you can **assume the FC stays constant**, and **subtract VC from TC**.
    
If you **don’t have Q = 0**, then:
- Assume FC = **TC at Q = 1** minus **VC at Q = 1**

Or if you're given TC at several outputs, you can estimate FC by:
> **FC = TC at any Q − VC at that Q**

You usually **infer** FC by noticing that the difference between TC and VC stays the same across outputs.


##### **Variable Cost (VC)**
> **VC = TC − FC**

Once you estimate FC from above, this is easy.


##### **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**
> **AFC = FC / Q**


##### **Marginal Cost**
This is the **change in Total Cost** when you increase output by 1 unit:
> **MC = ΔTC / ΔQ**

So:
- Pick two nearby quantities (e.g., Q = 3 and Q = 4)
- Use their total costs to get MC:

> **MC = (TC at Q = 4 − TC at Q = 3) / (4 − 3)**
