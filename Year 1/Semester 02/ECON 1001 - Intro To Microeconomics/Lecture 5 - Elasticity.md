**Elasticity:**
	A measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to one of its determinants.  
		• Price  
		• Income  
		• Other prices, etc

When an event affects a market, elasticity helps us quantify the quantity responses.

##### Price Elasticity Of Demand

The percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a 1 percent change in price.
$$\text{Price Elasticity of Demand } = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{Percentage change in price}} = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}$$


**Example :** 
A 10% increase in the price of books leads to a 30% decrease in quantity demanded.
$$\text{Price in elasticity for books} = \frac{-30\%}{10\%} = -3$$

Note : 
	Price and quantity demanded ALWAYS move in opposite directions → negative number  
	Economists often use the absolute value

##### Elastic vs Inelastic Demands

![[Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 1.21.12 PM.png]]
• Inelastic demand: $|\%\Delta Q| < |\%\Delta P|$
	• Perfectly inelastic demand: vertical demand (quantity is fixed)  

• Elastic demand: $|\%\Delta Q| > |\%\Delta P|$
	• Perfectly elastic demand: horizontal demand (price is fixed)  

• Unitary elastic demand: $|\%\Delta Q| = |\%\Delta P|$

Note that we compare absolute values of the percentage changes (if one is  
positive the other is negative–always!)

##### Determinants Of Price Elasticity Of Demand

Availability of substitutes  
	More substitutes → more elastic demand  
	
Necessities versus luxuries  
	Necessities → more inelastic demand  
	Luxuries → more elastic demand  

Definition of the market  
	Narrowly defined market → more elastic demand  
	Broadly defined market → more inelastic demand  
	Note: Which is more elastic, a brand vs category of goods?  

Consumers’ willingness to search  
	When consumers are more willing to search for a low-cost alternative, demand is more elastic.
 
Time horizon  
	The longer the time horizon → more elastic demand

##### Price Elasticity Of Demand Application: Total Revenue

The price elasticity of demand can help us predict the effect of a price change on total revenue  

Total revenue is given by  $$TR = P \times Q = PQ$$
If price increases, what is the change in TR?  $$TR? = P ↑ Q ↓$$
	Because P and Q move in opposite directions, what matters is whether they change in the same proportion or not ⇒ Elasticity  
		• Unitary elastic demand  
			If P increases 1% → Q drops 1% ⇒ TR will not change  
		• Elastic demand  
			If P increases 1% → Q drops more than 1% ⇒ TR will fall  
		• Inelastic demand  
			If P increases 1% → Q drops less than 1% ⇒ TR will increase

##### Other Demand Elastics

**Income elasticity of demand**  
	The pct. change in quantity in response to a 1% increase in income $$\text{Income elasticity of demand} = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \div \frac{\Delta I}{I}$$
	**Normal goods:** positive income elasticity  
	**Inferior goods:** negative income elasticity


**Cross-price elasticity of demand**
The pct. change in quantity in response to a 1% increase in the price of another good. $$\text{Cross price elasticity of Demand } = \frac{\Delta Q_{1}}{Q_{1}} \div \frac{\Delta P_{2}}{P_{2}}$$
	**Substitutes:** positive cross-price elasticity  
	**Complements:** negative cross-price elasticity

##### Price Elasticity Of Supply

The percentage change in quantity supplied in response to a 1 percent change in price. $$\text{Price elasticity of supply} = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}$$
**Price elasticity of supply can also be :**  
	• **Inelastic:** if the quantity change is less than proportional to the price change  
	• **Elastic:** if the quantity change is more than proportional to the price change  

**Determinants of supply elasticity: what makes it more flexible (elastic)?**  
	• Possibility of holding inventories (storable goods)  
	• Easily available inputs  
	• Idle capacity  
	• Easy entry/exit  
	• Longer time horizon
