##### Welfare Measures
We develop concepts of welfare measures with multiple goals, for e.g.:  
	• To evaluate the efficiency of different market structures (competition, monopoly, etc.)  
	• To evaluate the effects of government policies on markets  
	• To evaluate the effect of events that affect market outcomes

Marginal Cost

##### Consumer Surplus - Buyer's Welfare
The difference between a buyer’s willingness to pay and what they actually pay, i.e.  
marginal benefit minus price

**Willingness to pay :** 
	Maximum amount a buyer will pay for a good  
	The willingness to pay is closely related to the demand curve

**Consumer Surplus :** 
	The area under the demand curve and above the market price.

##### Producer Surplus - Seller's Welfare
The difference between the amount a seller is paid for a good and the seller’s marginal  
cost.

Above the Demand Line





**Efficiency In Competitive Markets**

Total surplus = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus  
Total surplus = (Marginal benefit to buyers - price) + (price - Marginal Cost to sellers)
Total surplus = Marginal benefit - Marginal Cost
Consumer Surplus = $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$
