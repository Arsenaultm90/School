##### Welfare Measures
We develop concepts of welfare measures with multiple goals, for e.g.:  
	• To evaluate the efficiency of different market structures (competition, monopoly, etc.)  
	• To evaluate the effects of government policies on markets  
	• To evaluate the effect of events that affect market outcomes


**Positive Economy**
- **Objective**: Focuses on facts, evidence, and causal relationships.
- **Testable**: Can be verified using data and analysis.
- **Descriptive**: Explains phenomena without recommending any specific action

**Normative Economy**
- **Subjective**: Based on values, ethics, or moral beliefs about what is desirable.
- **Non-testable**: Cannot be proven true or false through empirical data; depends on personal or societal values.
- **Prescriptive**: Offers recommendations on what ought to happen, rather than just explaining what is happening.

Marginal Benefit

Marginal Cost

##### Consumer Surplus - Buyer's Welfare
The difference between a buyer’s willingness to pay and what they actually pay, i.e.  
marginal benefit minus price

**Willingness to pay :** 
	Maximum amount a buyer will pay for a good  
	The willingness to pay is closely related to the demand curve

**Consumer Surplus :** 
	The area under the demand curve and above the market price.

##### Producer Surplus - Seller's Welfare
The difference between the amount a seller is paid for a good and the seller’s marginal  
cost.

Above the Demand Line



**Efficiency In Competitive Markets**

Total surplus = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus  
Total surplus = (Marginal benefit to buyers - price) + (price - Marginal Cost to sellers)
Total surplus = Marginal benefit - Marginal Cost
Consumer Surplus = $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$

**Market Failures And Deadweight Loss**
