- **Marginal Revenue**: The additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of output
- **Marginal Cost**: The additional cost of producing one more unit of output
- **Marginal Profit** = MR - MC = The additional profit from producing and selling one more unit

## Perfect Competition

**Characteristics:**
- Many small firms, none with market power
- Homogeneous (identical) products
- Perfect information for buyers and sellers
- Free entry and exit of firms
- Firms are price takers (cannot influence market price)

**Examples:** Agricultural markets, foreign exchange markets

**Key outcomes:**
- Price equals marginal cost (P = MC)
- Zero economic profit in long run
- Allocatively and productively efficient


---
## Monopolistic Competition

**Characteristics:**
- Many firms selling differentiated products
- Some degree of pricing power
- Free entry and exit
- Non-price competition (advertising, branding)

**Examples:** Restaurants, clothing stores, personal services

**Key outcomes:**
- Price exceeds marginal cost (P > MC)
- Zero economic profit in long run
- Excess capacity (firms produce less than optimal scale)
- Product variety benefits consumers


---
## Oligopoly

**Characteristics:**
- Few large firms dominate the market
- High barriers to entry
- Strategic interdependence (firms consider rivals' reactions)
- Products may be homogeneous or differentiated

**Examples:** Automotive industry, telecommunications, airlines

**Key outcomes:**
- Various pricing strategies depending on competition model
- Game theory often applies (Nash equilibrium)
- Potential for collusion or price leadership
- Economic profits possible in long run


---
## Monopoly

**Characteristics:**
- Single seller controls the market
- No close substitutes for the product
- High barriers to entry
- Firm is a price maker

**Examples:** Utilities, patented pharmaceuticals, local cable providers

**Key outcomes:**
- Price exceeds marginal cost (P > MC)
- Profit maximization where MR = MC
- Economic profits possible in long run
- Deadweight loss (allocative inefficiency)
- Price discrimination possible

## Profit-Maximizing Decisions with Market Power

Firms with market power (monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition) make profit-maximizing decisions differently than perfectly competitive firms:

1. **Price Setting vs. Price Taking**: Unlike perfect competitors, firms with market power can set their own prices.
2. **MR = MC Rule**: They still maximize profit where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, but face a downward-sloping demand curve.
3. **Price Above Marginal Cost**: These firms charge prices above marginal cost, creating a markup determined by the elasticity of demand.
4. **Output Restriction**: They typically produce less output than would occur in perfect competition.
5. **Strategic Considerations**: Oligopolies must account for competitor reactions when making decisions.

## Problems with Market Power

Market power creates several economic inefficiencies and problems:

1. **Deadweight Loss**: Reduced production and higher prices create allocative inefficiency (deadweight loss).
2. **Income Transfer**: Consumers pay more than necessary, transferring surplus from consumers to producers.
3. **Productive Inefficiency**: Firms don't produce at minimum average cost.
4. **Rent-Seeking Behaviour**: Companies spend resources to maintain market power rather than improve products.
5. **X-inefficiency**: Without competitive pressure, firms might become inefficient or complacent.
6. **Reduced Innovation**: Some argue monopolies have less incentive to innovate (though others argue the opposite).

## Public Policy to Limit Market Power

Governments use various approaches to address market power issues:

1. **Antitrust Laws**: Prevent mergers that reduce competition and prohibit anti-competitive behavior.
    - Examples: Sherman Act, Clayton Act in the US
2. **Regulation**:
    - Price regulation: Sets maximum prices for natural monopolies
    - Quality standards: Ensures minimum quality levels
    - Service requirements: Mandates universal service provision
3. **Public Ownership**: Government operates the service directly in some cases.
4. **Entry Promotion**: Policies that make it easier for new firms to enter markets.
5. **Patent Reform**: Balancing innovation incentives with competition.
6. **International Trade**: Opening markets to foreign competition can reduce domestic market power.
