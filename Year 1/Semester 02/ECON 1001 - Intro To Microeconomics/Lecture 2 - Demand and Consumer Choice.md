**Market :** 
	Group of buyers of a particular good and service.

##### Demand

**Demand :**
	Represents the quantity that buyers are willing and able to purchase at every possible price.

**Law of Demand :** 
	The quantity demanded falls as price increases, all else equal (ceteris paribus).

**Market Demand :**
	Sum of all **individual demands**.

**Estimating market demand**  
1. Run a survey to obtain many individual demands.
2. For each price, add up the total quantity for all customers.
3. Scale up the quantities to represent the whole market (a survey is just a subset).
4. Draw your market demand curve.


**The shape and position of the demand curve depends on:**  
	• The good’s own price
	• Consumers’ tastes or preferences  
	• Consumers’ income  
	• Normal goods  
	• Inferior goods  
	• Prices of related goods  
	• Complements  
	• Substitutes  
	• Number of buyers  
	• Expectations

**Increase in demand: Right Shift**  
	• Increase in income (normal goods)  
	• Increase in price of substitute  
	• Decrease in price of complement
