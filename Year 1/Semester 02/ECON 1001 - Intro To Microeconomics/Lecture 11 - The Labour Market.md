#### Supply And Demand At Work

This section compares the labour market to a regular product market (like the market for haircuts), but instead of buying products, businesses **buy labour** (i.e., work hours), and individuals **supply their time and skills**.

- The **price** in the labour market is the **wage** (e.g., hourly wage for a hairstylist).
- The **quantity** is the **number of hours worked**.
- **Wages and employment** are determined at the **intersection of labour supply and labour demand curves**.
    

In the labour market:
- **Workers** (like Chris the hairstylist) are the **suppliers**, deciding whether and how much to work based on wages.
- **Firms** (like hair salons) are the **demanders**, deciding how many workers (or work hours) to hire based on profitability.
    

Both the **labour supply** and **labour demand** curves follow familiar economic laws:
- **Labour supply curve is upward-sloping**: Higher wages = more people willing to work.
- **Labour demand curve is downward-sloping**: Higher wages = fewer hours businesses want to hire.
    

The decision-making on both sides follows **four economic principles**:
1. **Opportunity Cost Principle** – What are you giving up by working or hiring?
2. **Marginal Principle** – How much benefit do you get from hiring one more worker or working one more hour?
3. **Cost-Benefit Principle** – Is the benefit worth the cost?
4. **Interdependence Principle** – Decisions are affected by external factors (e.g., alternative jobs, rent, business hours).

##### Summary
- **The labour market works like any other market** — it has supply and demand, but the "product" is labour and the "price" is the wage.
    
- **You (as a worker) are on the supply side** of the labour market. Businesses are on the demand side.
    
- **Higher wages increase labour supply** (more people want to work), and **decrease labour demand** (businesses hire fewer hours).
    
- Understand how the **four core economic principles** guide decisions:
    - Workers decide based on wages vs. leisure/other jobs (opportunity cost).
    - Firms hire based on productivity vs. wage costs (marginal/cost-benefit).
        
- **Market equilibrium wage and employment** are where labour supply = labour demand.

#### Labour Demand : Thinking Like An Employer

##### **Key Concepts**
- **Perfectly Competitive Labour Market**: Gabriela is a buyer of labour in a market where many businesses compete to hire from a pool of similarly skilled workers. The **market wage** is fixed, and she can hire as many stylists as she wants at that wage.
    
- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: The additional cost of hiring one more worker — in this case, **$500 per week** (the wage).
    
- **Marginal Product of Labour (MP)**: The **extra number of haircuts** Gabriela expects from each new hire.
    
- **Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)**: The additional **revenue generated** from hiring one more stylist. $$MRP = MP \times \text{ Price Of A Haircut}$$
**Rational Rule for Employers**:
	 Hire workers as long as : $$MRP \ge Wage$$

**Example :** 

| Hair Stylist Hired | Marginal Product (Haircuts) | MRP (20$ x MRP) | Wage (500$) | Hire? |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 1                  | 40                          | $800            | $500        | yes   |
| 2                  | 35                          | $700            | $500        | yes   |
| 3                  | 30                          | $600            | $500        | yes   |
| 4                  | 25                          | $500            | $500        | yes   |
| 5                  | 20                          | $400            | $500        | no    |

Gabriela should hire **4 hair stylists**.
- The **first 4 stylists** each bring in **at least $500** in additional revenue (some bring in more), so hiring them makes financial sense.
- The **fifth stylist** only brings in **$400** in revenue but costs **$500**, so hiring them would reduce profit


##### The Rational Rule For Employers
Hire more workers as long as the marginal revenue product (MRP) of the worker is greater than or equal to the wage.
- **Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)** is how much extra revenue one more worker brings in.
- **Wage** is how much you pay that worker
- **Keep hiring** as long as each new worker **adds more to revenue than they cost**.
- **Stop hiring** once a worker’s MRP **equals the wage**.

**Why this works :**
- This rule ensures you're **maximizing profits**.
- Hiring too few means you're **missing out on extra profit**.
- Hiring too many means you're **paying more than you're gaining**.

**Result :**
The **labour demand curve** (how many workers employers want at each wage) **is the same as the MRP curve**, and it **slopes downward** due to **diminishing returns** — each extra worker adds a bit less than the last.

Gabriela’s labour demand curve is the same as her **MRP curve**, because:
- It shows **how many workers she’ll hire** at each wage.
- The **MRP declines** as more workers are hired (due to **diminishing marginal product**).
- Thus, her **labour demand curve is downward sloping**—just like any other demand curve.

This reflects the **Law of Demand**:
 When the **wage (price of labour)** goes down, **employers demand more labour.**


##### **The Rational Rule for Workers**
> **Work more hours if the additional benefit (wage) is greater than or equal to the additional cost (value of your time).**

- Just like employers, workers make decisions at the margin.
- The tradeoff: more work means more income, but also less leisure.
- So, workers **choose to work more when the wage is high enough to make giving up free time worth it**.

##### **The Substitution Effect**
> **When wages rise, work becomes more rewarding than leisure.**

- So, people are more likely to **substitute** away from leisure and choose to work more.
- **Higher wages → more work (from the substitution perspective).**

##### **The Income Effect**
> **When wages rise, people feel richer and can afford more leisure.**

- Some people might choose to **work less** because they can maintain their lifestyle with fewer hours.
- **Higher wages → less work (from the income perspective).**

##### **Putting it All Together**
- **At low wages:** Substitution effect dominates → people work more as wages rise.
- **At higher wages:** Income effect might take over → people might reduce hours even as wages increase.

##### **Three-Step Recipe for Analyzing Labour Market Changes**
1. **Is the labour supply or labour demand curve shifting (or both)?**
    - Example: A new technology makes workers more productive → **demand curve shifts right**.
        
2. **Is that shift an increase or decrease?**
    - Demand increase = shift **right**
    - Supply decrease = shift **left**, etc.
        
3. **How will wages and the number of jobs change in the new equilibrium?**
    - Use a **labour market graph**: Supply vs. Demand → New intersection shows new **wage** and **employment level**.
    - **Example:**
        - **Demand ↑** → Wages ↑, Jobs ↑
        - **Supply ↓** → Wages ↑, Jobs ↓

### **Summary** 

##### **Part 1: Rational Rule for Employers**

> **"Keep hiring until the wage equals the marginal revenue product of labour (MRPL)."**
- Employers want to **maximize profit**.
- They will hire more workers as long as each additional worker adds more to revenue than they cost in wages.
- **Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRPL)** = extra revenue from hiring one more worker.
- Profit is maximized when:  
    → **Wage = MRPL**
- The **labour demand curve** is the same as the **MRPL curve**.
    - It’s **downward-sloping** because of **diminishing marginal product**: each additional worker adds less output than the previous.
        

**Why this matters**: Following the rational rule ensures businesses don’t over- or under-hire — they get maximum profit.

---

##### **Part 2: Labour Demand**

- **Labour demand** depends on:
    1. **Price of the output** (higher prices = higher MRPL)
    2. **Productivity of workers** (higher productivity = higher MRPL)
    3. **Cost of capital** (cheaper machines = less demand for labour)
        
- **Law of Demand** applies:  
    Lower wages → Employers want to hire more.
    

---

##### **Part 3: Rational Rule for Workers**

> **"Work more if the wage is at least as high as the value of your time."**
- Workers compare the **benefit of working** (the wage) to the **opportunity cost** (lost leisure).
- They choose the number of hours that maximizes their well-being.
    

This rule helps explain **labour supply decisions**.

---

##### **Part 4: Substitution & Income Effects**

These help explain how workers respond to **changes in wages**:
- **Substitution Effect**:  
    → Higher wages make work more attractive than leisure → **work more**.
- **Income Effect**:  
    → Higher wages make you feel richer → you can afford more leisure → **work less**.
    

Which one dominates depends on the person and the wage level:
- At low wages → substitution effect usually stronger → more work.
- At high wages → income effect might take over → less work.

##### **Part 5: Labour Market Equilibrium & The 3-Step Recipe**

To analyze any change in the labour market, use this recipe:

1. **Which curve is shifting — supply or demand (or both)?**
2. **Is it increasing (shifting right) or decreasing (shifting left)?**
3. **How does that affect equilibrium wages and employment?**
    - **Demand ↑** → Wages ↑, Jobs ↑
    - **Supply ↑** → Wages ↓, Jobs ↑
    - **Demand ↓** → Wages ↓, Jobs ↓
    - **Supply ↓** → Wages ↑, Jobs ↓
        

This helps predict how events (like new technology, immigration, or policy changes) will affect the labour market.

##### How It All Ties Together:

At the heart of everything is the idea that **workers and employers respond to incentives**:
- Employers hire based on **marginal benefit vs. cost** → **Rational Rule for Employers**
- Workers work based on **wage vs. leisure value** → **Rational Rule for Workers**
- The interaction of both creates the **labour market**, where:
    - Wages are determined by supply & demand
    - Employment levels settle at an **equilibrium** where supply = demand
        

Understanding the **shapes of the curves**, the **rules people follow**, and the **factors that shift curves** lets you analyze and predict how real-world labour markets behave.
