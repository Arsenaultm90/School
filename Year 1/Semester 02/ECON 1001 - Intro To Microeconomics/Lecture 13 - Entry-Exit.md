##### **Entry-Exit (Market Dynamics)**
The **Entry-Exit** concept in economics refers to how firms **enter or leave a market** based on **profitability**:
- **Entry** occurs when existing firms are making **economic profits**, attracting new firms to enter the market.
- **Exit** occurs when firms are making **economic losses**, causing some to leave the market.
    

This dynamic helps move the market toward **long-run equilibrium**, where firms make **zero economic profit** (normal profit).


##### **Long-Run Profitability**
**Long-run profitability** refers to the **sustainable level of profit** that firms can expect in the **long run**, after all adjustments (like entry and exit) have occurred:
- In **perfect competition**, long-run profitability is **zero economic profit**, because entry and exit of firms drive prices to the level of **minimum average total cost**.
- In **monopolistic competition**, firms also tend to earn **zero economic profit** in the long run due to new entrants.
- In markets with **barriers to entry** (like monopoly or oligopoly), firms may earn **positive economic profit** even in the long run
