##### **Entry-Exit (Market Dynamics)**
The **Entry-Exit** concept in economics refers to how firms **enter or leave a market** based on **profitability**:
- **Entry** occurs when existing firms are making **economic profits**, attracting new firms to enter the market.
- **Exit** occurs when firms are making **economic losses**, causing some to leave the market.
    

This dynamic helps move the market toward **long-run equilibrium**, where firms make **zero economic profit** (normal profit).


##### **Long-Run Profitability**
**Long-run profitability** refers to the **sustainable level of profit** that firms can expect in the **long run**, after all adjustments (like entry and exit) have occurred:
- In **perfect competition**, long-run profitability is **zero economic profit**, because entry and exit of firms drive prices to the level of **minimum average total cost**.
- In **monopolistic competition**, firms also tend to earn **zero economic profit** in the long run due to new entrants.
- In markets with **barriers to entry** (like monopoly or oligopoly), firms may earn **positive economic profit** even in the long run


#### Price Taker
A **price taker** is a firm (or individual) that has **no control over the market price**. It must "take" the price as given — it **cannot influence the price** by changing its own level of output.

- A small wheat farmer: They sell in a huge market with thousands of other farmers. They can’t set the price — they just sell at the going rate.
    
- A gas station **might** be a price taker in a very competitive area where every station has the same price.

## Accounting vs. Economic Profit

**Accounting Profit:**
- Revenue minus explicit costs (actual monetary expenses)
- What shows up on financial statements
- Formula: Revenue - Explicit Costs

**Economic Profit:**
- Revenue minus ALL costs (explicit AND implicit)
- Includes opportunity costs (what you could have earned elsewhere)
- Formula: Revenue - (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs)
- Examples of implicit costs: owner's time, use of owned assets

A business can have positive accounting profit but zero economic profit if it's just covering all opportunity costs.

## Average Revenue

- Total revenue divided by quantity sold
- In most cases, average revenue equals price
- Formula: TR/Q = P

## Average Cost

- Total cost divided by quantity sold
- Formula: TC/Q = AC
- Types:
    - Average Fixed Cost (AFC): Fixed costs ÷ Quantity
    - Average Variable Cost (AVC): Variable costs ÷ Quantity
    - Average Total Cost (ATC): Total costs ÷ Quantity

## Free Entry and Exit in the Long Run

- In perfectly competitive markets with free entry/exit:
    - If economic profits exist, new firms enter
    - If economic losses exist, firms exit
    - The industry reaches long-run equilibrium where P = minimum ATC
    - Result: Zero economic profit in long run
- In monopolistic competition:
    - Free entry drives economic profit to zero
    - But firms produce at less than minimum ATC (excess capacity)

## Barriers to Entry

These protect firms with market power from competition:

**Legal Barriers:**
- Patents and copyrights
- Government licenses
- Regulatory requirements

**Natural Barriers:**
- Economies of scale (high fixed costs)
- Network effects
- Control of essential resources
- Brand loyalty and switching costs
- High capital requirements

Barriers to entry allow firms to maintain economic profit in the long run, unlike in perfectly competitive markets.
