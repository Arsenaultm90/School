**Market Equilibrium :** 
	The price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. There is no tendency for change. There is a balance.


**Adam Smith's Invisible Hand**
Even if, for some reason, markets are not in equilibrium, market forces will drive it back to the equilibrium.

(D) - If P = $1.6 → excess supply or surplus  
(E) - If P = $1.2 → excess demand or shortage  
(C) - If P = $1.4, the market is in equilibrium


Analyzing the effect of a market event on the market equilibrium  
1. Does the event affect demand or supply or both?  
2. In what direction (increase or decrease)?  
3. How does that change equilibrium price and quantity?


**Example :** 
There is a sudden heat wave. What happens to the ice-cream market?  

1. **Demand or supply?**  
	Demand

2. **Increase or decrease?**  
	Increase

3. **Equilibrium change?**
- **Equilibrium Price**: As demand increases and supply remains constant, the equilibrium price of ice cream is likely to **rise**, since more people are competing for the same quantity of ice cream available.

- **Equilibrium Quantity**: The equilibrium quantity of ice cream will also **increase**, as sellers produce and sell more to meet the heightened demand.


**Example :** 
The price of sugar increases. What happens to the ice-cream market?  
1. Demand or supply?  
	Supply

2. Increase or decrease?  
	Decrease

3. Equilibrium change?
	Price increases
	Supply decreases


**Example :** 
What if both curves shift at the same time?  
Event: Price of sugar rises and weather is hot.  
1. Demand or supply?  
	Both
2. Increase or decrease?  
	Increase Demand, Decrease Supply
2. Equilibrium change?  
	Depends on which event has the large shift.
	Price increases
	Supply Decreases
