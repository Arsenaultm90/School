##### Four Principles of Economics

**Cost-Benefit Principle**
**Benefits :** Willingness to pay  
**Costs :** Financial + non-financial costs

**Opportunity Cost Principle**
You should always consider the best alternative you are giving up (trade-off), not just the out-of-pocket expense.
Sunk costs are irrelevant to any decision because they are present in every alternative course of action. Sunk costs are never part of your opportunity cost.
Examples:  
	• Leaving in the middle of a movie  
	• Changing majors

**Marginal Principle**
In order to make marginal decisions we compare marginal benefits and marginal costs.
Rational rule: If something is worth doing, keep doing it until marginal benefits equal marginal costs.

**Interdependence Principle**
There is dependence between your own choices  
There is dependence between economic actors: choices made by other  
economic actors (people, businesses, etc) shape the choices available to  
you  
There is dependence between markets  
There is dependence through time

should be.
