##### Price Ceiling

A legal maximum on the price at which a good/service can be sold.
	Lower prices are allowed  
	Price ceiling is only binding if it is below the market price

Price ceilings are typically applied in politically/socially sensitive markets  
	• Gasoline  
	• Rental housing  
Some price ceilings are zero, virtually eliminating markets  
	• Kidneys  
Effects of price ceilings  
	• If binding, price is lower than the market equilibrium  
	• Quantity is smaller than the market equilibrium – supply shortages  
	• Units sold are not necessarily allocated to consumers that value them most  
	• Buyers might incur additional search costs

##### Price Floor

A legal minimum on the price at which a good/service can be sold.
	Higher prices are allowed  
	Price floor is only binding if it is above the market price

Examples : 
Minimum wage
Minimum cigarette price laws  
Minimum alcohol price (Scotland)

##### Quantity Controls / Regulations

**Quantity Regulation:** 
	A legal minimum OR maximum quantity that can be sold.

**Mandate :** 
	A requirement to buy or sell a minimum amount
	**Examples:**  
		• A car insurance mandate for every driver to have liability insurance  
		• A housing mandate requiring developers to build low-income housing with any large development

**Binding Mandate :** 
	The mandate needs to be a quantity that is greater than the equilibrium quantity.

**Quota :** 
	A limit on the maximum quantity of a good that can be bought or sold.
	**Examples:**  
		• Cannabis consumption has a limit on how much you can purchase  
		• Many cities have a maximum number of taxis allowed  
		• China’s one-child policy (1980-2015)

**Binding Quota :** 
	The quota needs to be a quantity that is less than the equilibrium quantity.

##### Taxes

**Tax Incidence :** 
	The manner in which the burden of a tax is shared among participants in a market.

**Tax On Buyers :**
	Affects Demand
	Shifts Demand to the left
	Price and quantity decrease in equilibrium

**Tax On Sellers :** 
	Affects Supply
	Shifts Supply to the left
	Price increases and quantity decreases

**Tax on buyers or sellers: is there a difference?**
![[Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 7.39.39 AM.png]]

Whether a tax is paid to the government by buyers or sellers makes no difference  
	• Quantity will always be lower  
	• Price paid by consumers will always be higher  
	• Price received by sellers will always be lower  
	• The wedge between the prices is the tax  
	• Both buyers and sellers will bear some of the burden of the tax  

What determines who has the largest tax incidence?  
	• Supply and demand elasticities

**Tax Incidence Example :** 
Because a tax creates a wedge between prices paid by buyers and received by sellers, we label them : $$Q^D = 56 - 4P_{B}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; Q^S = -4+2P_{S}$$
Assume $t=1.50\$$

$$ \begin{array}{c|c} \textbf{Tax Paid By Buyer} & \textbf{Tax Paid By Seller} \\ \hline \displaystyle P_{B}= P_{S}+t & \displaystyle P_{S}= P_{B}-t \\[10pt] \displaystyle Q^{D} = Q^S & Q^{D} = Q^S \\
56-4P_{B} = -4+2P_{S} & 56-4P_{B} = -4+2P_{S}\\
56-4(P_{S}+1.5) = -4+2P_{S} & 56-4P_{B} = -4+2(P_{B}-1.5 )\\
56-6+4=6P_{S} & 6P_{B} = 56 + 4 + 3 \\
\frac{54}{6} = P_{s} & \displaystyle P_{B} = \frac{63}{6}  
 \\[10pt] \displaystyle P_{s} = 9 & P_{B} = 10.5 \\
P_{B} = 9 + 1.5 = 10.5 &P_{S} = 10.5 - 1.5 = 9 \\
Q^D = 56-4(10.5) = 14 & \displaystyle Q^S  = -4+2(9) = 14\\
\end{array}$$


Based on standard tax burden principles:
1. If demand and supply are equally elastic, the tax burden is **split evenly**.
2. If demand is inelastic relative to supply, **consumers bear most of the tax**.
3. If supply is inelastic relative to demand, **sellers bear most of the tax**
