What is an externality?  
	• Positive and negative externalities  
	• Inefficiencies created by externalities  
	• Corrections to markets with externalities

The uncompensated impact (or side effect) of one person’s/firm’s actions on the well-being of a bystander.  
	• Positive externality: Impact is positive but benefit is infeasible to charge for.  
	• Negative externality: Impact is negative but cost is infeasible to charge to not provide.

**Examples:**  
	• Vaccines  
	• A neighbour with a beautiful garden  
	• An industry that pollutes as part of its production process.  
	• Construction noise  
	• Smoking  
	• Antibiotics (positive or negative externality?)  
	• Driving (congestion)

#### Externalities And Market Inefficiency

Externalities are an example of market failure  
	• Market failure: situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market (total surplus is not maximized)  
	• Negative externality ⇒ too much will be produced in a free market  
	• Positive externality ⇒ too little will be produced in a free market  
	
Markets where externalities are present are inefficient

**Public Goods: non excludable, non rival**  
• Free-riding problem  
• Markets cannot provide public goods efficiently (sometimes not at all)  
• Typically resolved by the government providing the good  
• Other solutions: peer pressure, privatization, contracts  

**Common resources: non excludable, rival**  
• Tragedy of the commons problem  
• Markets alone cannot provide these goods efficiently  
• Typically resolved through regulation that restricts access to the good
