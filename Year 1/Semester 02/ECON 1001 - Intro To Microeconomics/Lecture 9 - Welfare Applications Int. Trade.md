#### Taxation

A tax leads to  
	• Lower traded quantity  
	• Higher price paid by buyers  
	• Lower price received by sellers  
	• Higher tax revenue collected by the government  

How does this affect total surplus?  
	• Lower consumer and producer surplus  
	• Tax revenue that can be used to increase consumer/producer welfare elsewhere  
	• When the government is involved:  
		Total Surplus = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus + Govt. Revenue

**What determines the magnitude of the deadweight loss (DWL)?**  
	• The amount of the tax: larger tax, larger DWL, all else equal  
	• The elasticity of the supply and demand curves  
		• The more inelastic supply, the lower the DWL, holding demand and tax fixed  
		• The more inelastic demand, the lower the DWL, holding supply and tax fixed

#### International Trade

**Gains from Trade**:
    - Gains from trade exist when countries specialize in producing the goods they have a **comparative advantage** in. This is the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost compared to other countries.
    - **The larger the differences in opportunity costs**, the greater the potential gains from trade, as countries can specialize more, increasing the overall global output.

 **Specialization and Comparative Advantage**:
    - **Specialization** allows countries to focus on the goods they can produce most efficiently, leading to increased overall production and consumption.
    - **Comparative advantage** explains that even if one country is more efficient at producing both goods, trade can still be mutually beneficial if they specialize based on their relative efficiencies.

**Productivity Gains and Innovation**:
    - Specialization in production leads to **higher productivity** as countries refine their expertise in specific industries. This can also encourage **technological innovation**, which leads to further improvements in efficiency.
    - **Economies of scale** can also result from specialization, where the cost per unit of goods decreases as the quantity produced increases.

**Increased Total Welfare**:
    - **International trade increases total global welfare** by making more goods available at lower prices and increasing global production.
    - **However, not everyone benefits equally**. While the global economy as a whole benefits, some groups may lose out, especially those in industries that face increased competition from trade.

 **Impact on Consumers and Producers**:
    - **Consumers of the exporting industry** may lose, as domestic prices can increase due to reduced competition from foreign goods.
    - **Producers in the exporting industry** gain, as they can sell goods to international markets, potentially at higher prices or in larger quantities.
    - **Consumers of the importing industry** gain because they can access cheaper or higher-quality goods from abroad.
    - **Producers in the importing industry** lose because they face increased competition, which may reduce prices and market share for their domestic goods.

#### Tariffs

 **Definition and Impact**:
    - **Tariffs** are taxes imposed on imported goods. While tariffs raise government revenue, they also distort market prices and reduce trade between countries.
    - **Deadweight loss** occurs because tariffs lead to a reduction in the quantity of trade and a less efficient allocation of resources, as consumers pay higher prices and producers face less competition.

**Consumer and Producer Effects**:
    - **Consumers** are harmed by tariffs, as they face higher prices for imported goods. This reduces their purchasing power and the variety of goods available.
    - **Domestic Producers** in import-competing industries may benefit, as tariffs protect them from foreign competition and allow them to charge higher prices.
    - **The Government** collects tariff revenue, but this is generally smaller than the welfare loss caused by the reduction in trade.

**Overall Effect on Welfare**:
    - While some domestic producers benefit from tariffs, the **deadweight loss**—the inefficiency caused by reduced trade—is larger than the benefits from protection.
    - The tariff creates a **redistribution of wealth** from consumers to producers and the government, but it lowers total welfare in the economy.



Determining Producer Surplus
$$ \frac{Base \times height}{2}$$

**Example:**
Suppose the accompanying graph depicts the market for sugar in a hypothetical country. Suppose the country opens trade with the world sugar market and becomes a sugar exporter.

When trade with the world market opens, Costa Rica becomes an exporter. The reason for this must be that the world price is higher than the previous domestic price in Costa Rica, so producers decide to export. After you move the price line upwards, the next step is to adjust producer and consumer surplus. Consumer surplus decreases, as consumers now pay a higher price per pound of sugar, while producer surplus will increase.

The price of sugar rises from $15/pound, the previous domestic price, to $21, the new world price.

After trade opens, at $21/pound, only 60 pounds of sugar will be demanded domestically while producers will desire to produce 140 pounds. As a result, they will meet the demand for 60 pounds and export the remaining 80 pounds to the world market.

Lastly, by taking the area of the new producer surplus, it becomes clear that the value has increased to:$$\frac{$21\times 140}{2} = $1{,}470 $$
