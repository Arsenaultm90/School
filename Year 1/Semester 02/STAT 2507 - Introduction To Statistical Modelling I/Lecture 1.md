##### Statistics Nomenclature

**Statistics** - The study of how to collect, summarize, and interpret data.

**Descriptive Statistics** - The science of describing the important   aspects of a set of measurements through the use of graphical displays and numerical summaries.

**Inferential Statistics** - The science of making inferences about the characteristics of a population using a sample of measurements drawn from that population.

**Population** - Any set of people or objects. Each person or object is referred to more generally as an experimental unit.

**Sample** - Subset of a population.

**Variable** - Any characteristic of an experimental unit.

##### Types of Data

**Univariate Data** - The resulting data of a single variable measured from an experimental unit.

**Multivariate Data** - The resulting data of two(or more) variables measured from an experimental unit.


---
##### Types of Variables

**Qualitative Variable** - The measure of a quality or characteristic on each unit.

**Quantitative Variable** - The measure of a numerical quantity on each unit.
	There are two type of **Quantitative Variables** : Discrete and Continuous
	A variable with a finite or countable number of values is **discrete**.
		Ex. The number of dots obtained when you roll a single die.
	A variable that can assume any value within a continuous interval of  
	values is **continuous**.
		Ex. The temperature in °C on any given day in Ottawa.

If the variable **represents counts** of things, it’s **discrete**.
If the variable **is measured** and can theoretically take any value within a range, it’s **continuous**.

##### Graphs for Qualitative Data

If we have a set of qualitative (i.e. categorical) measurements, then we can measure how often each category occurs by determining one of the following values:  
1. The frequency, or number, of measurements in each category.  
2. The relative frequency, or proportion, of measurements in each  
category.  
3. The percentage of measurements in each category.  

These values can be graphed in a bar chart or a pie chart to give a visual display of how often each category occurs relative to others.

**Ex:**
In our sample, there are:  
23 Toyotas, 27 Chevrolets, 20 Fords, 34 Hondas, 16 Chryslers, 10 cars of other(e.g. BMW, Tesla, etc.)

##### Graphs for Quantitative Data

There are several different graphs that can be used to present quantitative data which are situation dependent.  If a quantitative variable is measured over different categories, we  
can use a bar chart or pie chart to describe the data, replacing frequency with the measurement of interest.

Many sets of quantitative consist of numbers that cannot be separated into categories. Three common ways to present this type of data graphically are a histogram, a stem-and-leaf plot, and a dot plot.

##### Stem and Leaf Plot

To generate a stem-and-leaf plot, each data observation is split into a stem and a leaf. The leaf is the rightmost digit. The stem consists of all remaining digits.  

**Example:** 15.63 would be written as 156 | 3.  

The number of leaves attached to each stem corresponds to the frequency of that particular stem. The leaf values are written in ascending order.  

**Example:** 15.63 and 15.61 are written as 156 | 13.  

To read values from a stem-and-leaf plot, we need the leaf unit. The leaf unit tells us what decimal place the leaf corresponds to. For the examples above, the leaf unit is 0.01.

##### Interpreting Graphs for Quantitative Data

When interpreting a graph based on quantitative data, we should attempt to describe the distribution of values by commenting on  
- the overall shape of the distribution,  
- the typical or central value of the distribution,  
- the spread or variation within the distribution, and  
- deviations from the overall pattern; i.e. outliers.  

**Outliers** are individual values that fall outside the overall pattern,  
typically unusually large or small data values.


**Describing the Shape of a Distribution**

A distribution is unimodal if it has a single peak.

A distribution is bimodal if it has two peaks. These peaks need not be the same height.![[Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 3.26.00 PM.png]]

##### Time Series

The quantitative data we have dealt with so far are cross-sectional data; that is, data observed at a single point in time.  

A time series is a set of measurements collected sequentially over time, typically with equally spaced intervals between measurements.
