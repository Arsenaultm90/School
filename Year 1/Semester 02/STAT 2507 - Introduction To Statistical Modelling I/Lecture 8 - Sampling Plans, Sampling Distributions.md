**Experiments :** 
	In an experiment, the researcher actively manipulates one or more variables (called independent variables) and measures the response (dependent variable). The goal is to establish **cause-and-effect** relationships.

**Observational Study :**
	In an observational study, the researcher **does not manipulate** any variables but instead observes and records data as it naturally occurs.

#### Simple Random Sample

A **simple random sample**, or **random sample**, is a sample in which the units included in the sample are chosen at random from the population. As a result,  
	▪ Every unit in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample, and  
	▪ Every sample of the same size has an equal chance of being chosen.

**In order to select a random sample, use the following steps:**  
1. Identify the population of interest.  
2. Obtain the sampling frame; a list of all units in the population.  
3. Assign a number to each unit in the population.  
4. Generate random numbers to identify which units to include in the sample until the desired sample size is reached.


**Example :** 
A class contains 26 students. Seven students from this class will be selected to go on a field trip using a simple random sample.  

Selection will be done according to the following lines of randomly generated digits:  
1559 9068 9290 8303 8508 8954 1051 6677 6415  
0342 5550 6245 7313 0117 7652 5069 6354 7668  

Which seven students get to go on the field trip?

#### Other Sampling Plans Involving Randomization

In addition to a simple random sample, we can also consider the following sampling plans that involve randomization:  
	▪ Stratified Random Sampling  
	▪ Cluster Sampling  
	▪ 1-in-k Systematic Sampling
