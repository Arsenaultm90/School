#### Population Mean
$$\displaylines{\mu = \frac{\sum^{N}_{i = 1}X_{i}}{N} = \frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\dots+X_{N}}{N}}$$

#### Sample Mean
$$\displaylines{\overline{X} = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i = 1}}{n} = \frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\dots+X_{n}}{n}}$$

#### Range 
$$Max - min$$

#### Population Variance
$$\displaylines{\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1}(X_{i}-\mu)^2}{N}}$$
#### Sample Variance
$$\displaylines{s^2 = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(X_{i} - \overline{X})^2}{n-1} \\ \\ OR \\ \\
\displaylines{s^2 = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}X^2_{i}-[({\sum^{n}_{i=1}}X_{i})^2 \;/\; n]}{n-1}}}$$

#### Standard Deviation
$$\displaylines{\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2 }\\s = \sqrt{ s^2 }}$$


#### The Empirical Rule
68% of data points in first deviation range
95% of data points in second deviation range


#### Correlation Coefficient (r)
 **Direction of the relationship**
    - Positive (r>0) : Both variables increase together.
    - Negative (r<0) : One variable increases while the other decreases.
    - Zero (r=0) : No clear linear relationship.

**Strength of the relationship**
    - **Close to 1 or -1** → Strong correlation (data points follow a clear pattern).
    - **Close to 0** → Weak or no correlation (data points are more scattered).



#### Tchebysheff's Theorem
$$\displaylines{k = \frac{|\overline{X} - z|}{\sigma} \\ \\
1-\frac{1}{k^2}}$$


#### Percentiles
$$\frac{P}{100}(n+1)$$
$$\displaylines{\text{Linear Interpolation :} \\
x_{i} + (decimal \times (x_{i+1}-x_{i}))}$$


#### Quartiles
You can calculate the following values using the percentile formulas above.

Q1 - 25th Percentile
Q3 - 75th Percentile
IQR = Q3 - Q1

#### Population Correlation Coefficient
Measures the relationship between two variables, X and Y. 
It indicates the strength and direction of the relationship.
$$−1≤ρ≤1$$

- $ρ>0$ (Positive correlation): As one variable increases, the other tends to increase → **Upward slope**
- $ρ<0$ (Negative correlation): As one variable increases, the other tends to decrease → **Downward slope**
- $ρ=1$ (Perfect positive correlation): All points lie **exactly** on a straight line with a positive slope
- $ρ=−1$ (Perfect negative correlation): All points lie **exactly** on a straight line with a negative slope
- $ρ=0$ (No correlation): No linear relationship between the variables
$$r = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_{x}s_{y}}$$

#### The Least Squares Regression Line
Finding the slope of a the line of best fit.
$$\displaylines{m = r\frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}\\\; b = \overline{y} - m\overline{x} \\ \\
\overline{x} - \text{ The mean of all x-values}\\
\overline{y} - \text{ The mean of all y-values}}$$

#### Probability


Conditional Probability
Independent Events

##### The Total Law Of Probability
Usable when we have a partitioned sample space and we want to find the probability of 'A' happening.

##### Baye's Rule
Used to find the reverse conditional probability.
