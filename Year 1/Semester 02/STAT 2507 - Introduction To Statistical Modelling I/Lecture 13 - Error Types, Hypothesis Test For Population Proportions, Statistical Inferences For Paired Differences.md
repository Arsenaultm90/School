#### **Type I & Type II Errors**
(Section 9.3)

A **Type I error** is committed when the null hypothesis is true but we  
reject it. (“Convicting an innocent person.”)  

A **Type II error** is committed when the null hypothesis is false but we  
fail to reject it. (“Setting a guilty person free.”)


**Probability of a Type I Error : $$P(\text{Type I Error}) = P(\text{Reject } H_{0} | H_{0} \text{ is true} ) = \alpha$$**

**Probability of a Type II Error : $$\displaylines{P(\text{Type II Error}) = P(\text{Fail to reject } H_{0} | H_{0} \text{ is false}) = \beta \\
\text{Power of the test} = P(\text{Reject } H_{0} | H_{0} \text{ is false}) = 1 - \beta}$$

**Example :** 
A researcher plans to conduct a hypotheses test at = 0.01. The study is designed so that, for a fixed value of the parameter of interest, the probability of a Type II error is 0.10. If the null hypothesis is correct, what is the probability that the researcher will reject $H_{0}$ ?  

(A) 0.01  
(B) 0.10  
(C) 0.90  
(D) 0.09  
(E) Cannot be determined.

The answer is "A" which equal $\alpha$ which represents the probability that a **Type I Error** occurs.
