#### Conversational Maxim's

**Conversational Maxims** are part of **Grice’s Cooperative Principle** in linguistics and pragmatics. They explain how people **understand implied meaning** and how conversations stay meaningful and efficient.

#### Grice's Cooperative Principle (1975)
Grice proposed that speakers generally follow a **"Cooperative Principle"**, which says:

> _"Make your contribution as required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange."_

This principle is divided into **four maxims**, or conversational rules.

#### The Four Conversational Maxims

 1. **Maxim of Quantity** – _Say enough, but not too much._
	- ✅ Give as much information as is needed — no more, no less.
	- ❌ Violation: Giving too much or too little info.

> A: "How was your day?"  
> B: "I got up." ← Violates Quantity (not enough info)


 2. **Maxim of Quality** – _Be truthful._
	- ✅ Do not say what you believe to be false.
	- ✅ Don’t say things you lack evidence for.
	- ❌ Violation: Lying, sarcasm (on the surface), exaggerating.

> "I can run 100 miles in an hour." ← Violates Quality


 3. **Maxim of Relation** – _Be relevant._
- ✅ Say things that are related to the topic.
- ❌ Violation: Changing the subject without reason.

> A: "Did you do your homework?"  
> B: "Look, it's snowing!" ← Violates Relation


 4. **Maxim of Manner** – _Be clear._
	- ✅ Avoid obscurity or ambiguity.
	- ✅ Be brief and orderly.
	- ❌ Violation: Being confusing, too wordy, vague.

> "I saw a thing near the thing we saw the other day." ← Violates Manner
