 Semantics Part One Chapter 6 (pg. 181-198)

#### Semantics
Semantics is concerned with meaning in language.  
It can be studied from three main perspectives:  

**• Lexical Semantics (Word Meaning) :** 
	How words are  defined, understood and relate to one another  
• **Compositional Semantics (Interpretation of Sentences) :**  
	Role of syntactic structure in the interpretation of sentences  
• **Pragmatics :** 
	Role of social and general knowledge in sentence interpretation

#### Semantic Relations  

##### Lexical Level  
• Synonymy  
• Antonymy  
• Polysemy  
• Homophony, Homography, Homonymy


---
##### Synonymy
Words which have the same meaning in some (or all) contexts.

| Word 1     | Word 2 |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Sick       | Ill    |
| Automobile | Car    |
| Remember   | Recall |
| Purchase   | Buy    |

Pure synonymy is rare – context usually dictates difference between them.
	• Christmas = holiday; vacation  
	• Canada Day = holiday; vacation  
	• “What adolescent behaviour!”  
	• “What youth behaviour!



---
##### Antonymy
Words that mean the opposite of each other to some (or full) extent.

| Word 1 | Word 2 |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dark   | Light  |
| Boy    | Girl   |
| Hot    | Cold   |
| Up     | Down   |

##### Polysemy
Polysemy in linguistics refers to the phenomenon where a single word has multiple related meanings. Involves one word that has several **semantically connected** senses.


**Example:**
The word **"head"**:
- _He bumped his **head**._ (body part)
- _She is the **head** of the department._ (leader)
- _Let’s start at the **head** of the line._ (beginning or top)

All of these meanings are conceptually linked—something at the "top" or something that leads.


---
##### Homophony
**Homophony** in linguistics refers to the phenomenon where two or more words **sound the same** (have the same pronunciation) but have **different meanings** — and often **different spellings** and **origins**.


**Example :**
**to / too / two**
    - _Go **to** the store._
    - _I want to go **too**._
    - _I have **two** apples._

**pair / pear / pare**
    - _A **pair** of shoes._
    - _A ripe **pear**._
    - _To **pare** down expenses._

**flour / flower**
    - _Baking with **flour**_
    - _A blooming **flower**_


---
##### Hyponomy
**Hyponomy** is the relationship between a more specific word (**hyponym**) and a more general word (**hypernym**).
- A **hyponym** is a kind of thing that falls under the category of a **hypernym**.
    

**Example :**
- **Dog** is a hyponym of **animal**
- **Rose** is a hyponym of **flower**
- **Banana** is a hyponym of **fruit**

> "A **dog** _is a kind of_ **animal**."

This creates a **semantic hierarchy**, which helps with things like categorizing knowledge and understanding word relationships.



---
##### Fuzzy Concepts
A **fuzzy concept** (or **fuzzy category**) refers to a concept that **doesn’t have a clear-cut boundary** — membership in the category is **graded**, not absolute.


**Example:**
- The concept of **"tall"**  
    Is someone who is 5'10" tall? Depends on context. Compared to what? It's not black and white.
- The concept of **"game"** (Wittgenstein's famous example)  
    Board games, sports, video games — they don't all share one single feature, but are **family-resemblances**.
    

In fuzzy concepts, truth values or category membership might be **on a spectrum** instead of binary (yes/no). This is studied more formally in **fuzzy logic**, but in linguistics, it highlights how natural language is flexible and context-dependent.
