#### Syntax Terminology: Lexical/Syntactic Categories

In order of universality  
	• Predicate: a verb phrase (_go to the store)  
	• Verb (V): action/stative word (go, am, is, drive)  
	• Noun (N): person, place, thing (___dog)  
	• Adjective (Adj): describes a noun (_ fluffy dog)  
	• Adverb (Adv): describes the predicate (when, frequency, or how the action takes place) (usually, slowly, everyday)  
	• Determiner (Det): specifies the noun (the___, a __, this__)  
	• Preposition (P): specifies a location (in, on, under, to, from)

#### Syntax Terminology: Structure

1. Subject: The entity doing the action or state  
2. Verb: an action or state  
3. Object: the entity receiving the action or state  
4. Phrase: a group of 2+ words that express an idea and act as one lexical category (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.). Not a “complete” sentence.  
5. Clause: A group of words that have a subject and a predicate (verb phrase)  
6. Sentence: expresses a complete thought and contains a subject and a predicate (verb phrase)

#### Syntax : Word Order

Subject -> Verb -> Object

Example :
	Bob likes Sally

#### Basic Syntactic Tree Structure

We rarely use 3-word sentences, so we expand the category to “phrase” which facilitates all the words to fit into the tree.

#### Co-Occurence

Phrases are structures containing words that co-occur.

There are three categories/types of co-occurrence:  
A. Arguments  
B. Adjuncts  
C. Agreement

##### Arguments : 
Any element (or constituent) in a sentence that is required. In English: often a verb requires an NP (Object)

Example : 
	Sally devoured an apple.

“Devoured” requires both a SUBJECT and an OBJECT.  
Here, “Sally” and “an apple” ARGUMENTS
	Sally - Subject Argument
	An Apple - Object Argument/Complement


##### Adjuncts :
Optional occurrence in a sentence. Modify (add information to) an argument.

Example : 
	Sally likes <u>small</u> <u>fluffy</u> <u>brown</u> dogs.

These occur together, but they are not required for the meaning or completion of the sentence.  
These adjectives are adjuncts, not arguments.
These adjuncts modify the argument “dogs”.  These are MODIFIERS.


##### Agreement :
Words may require certain morphological forms for their arguments. Often: Number, Case, Gender, etc.

**Subject-Verb Agreement**:
- In many languages, the **subject** and **verb** must agree in **number** (singular or plural) and sometimes **person** (first, second, or third).

**Noun-Adjective Agreement**:
- In some languages, **adjectives** must agree with the **nouns** they modify in terms of **number** and **gender**.

**Pronoun-Noun Agreement**:
- In languages with gendered pronouns (like **he/she/it**), the **pronoun** must agree with the **noun** it replaces in terms of **gender**, **number**, and **person**.
