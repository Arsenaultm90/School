#### Syntax Terminology: Lexical/Syntactic Categories

In order of universality  
	• Predicate: a verb phrase (_go to the store)  
	• Verb (V): action/stative word (go, am, is, drive)  
	• Noun (N): person, place, thing (___dog)  
	• Adjective (Adj): describes a noun (_ fluffy dog)  
	• Adverb (Adv): describes the predicate (when, frequency, or how the action takes place) (usually, slowly, everyday)  
	• Determiner (Det): specifies the noun (the___, a __, this__)  
	• Preposition (P): specifies a location (in, on, under, to, from)

#### Syntax Terminology: Structure

1. Subject: The entity doing the action or state  
2. Verb: an action or state  
3. Object: the entity receiving the action or state  
4. Phrase: a group of 2+ words that express an idea and act as one lexical category (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.). Not a “complete” sentence.  
5. Clause: A group of words that have a subject and a predicate (verb phrase)  
6. Sentence: expresses a complete thought and contains a subject and a predicate (verb phrase)

#### Syntax : Word Order

Subject -> Verb -> Object

Example :
	Bob likes Sally

#### Basic Syntactic Tree Structure

We rarely use 3-word sentences, so we expand the category to “phrase” which facilitates all the words to fit into the tree.

#### Constituents

A **constituent** is a group of words that acts as a single unit in the syntax of a sentence.

##### Examples of constituents:
- **[The quick brown fox]** jumped.
- She saw **[a man with binoculars]**.

##### Common constituent types:
- **NP (Noun Phrase)**: the dog, a big city
- **VP (Verb Phrase)**: eats apples, will be running
- **PP (Prepositional Phrase)**: on the table, under the bed
- **CP (Complementizer Phrase)**: that he left

##### Tests For Constituency :
 1. **Substitution Test**
	- Replace the phrase with a single word (pronoun, do so, etc.)
	- If it works, it’s likely a constituent.

> She saw **[the big dog]**. → She saw **it**. 


 2. **Movement Test (Clefting, Fronting)**
	- Move the group of words to the front.
	- If the sentence still makes sense, it’s a constituent.

> **[The big dog]**, she saw. 
> It was **[the big dog]** that she saw. _(Clefting)_


 3. **Coordination Test**
	- Coordinate the suspected constituent with a similar structure.

> She saw **[the big dog]** and **[the angry cat]**. ✅


4. **Stand-Alone Test (Answers to Questions)**
	- Can the phrase answer a WH-question?

> What did she see? → **The big dog.** ✅


 5. **Ellipsis Test**
	- Can it be left out in ellipsis constructions?

> She saw the big dog, and he did too. ✅  
> (“did” replaces “see the big dog” → showing “the big dog” was part of the same VP)

#### Co-Occurence

Phrases are structures containing words that co-occur.

There are three categories/types of co-occurrence:  
A. Arguments  
B. Adjuncts  
C. Agreement

##### Arguments : 
Any element (or constituent) in a sentence that is required. In English: often a verb requires an NP (Object)

Example : 
	Sally devoured an apple.

“Devoured” requires both a SUBJECT and an OBJECT.  
Here, “Sally” and “an apple” ARGUMENTS
	Sally - Subject Argument
	An Apple - Object Argument/Complement


##### Adjuncts :
Optional occurrence in a sentence. Modify (add information to) an argument.

Example : 
	Sally likes <u>small</u> <u>fluffy</u> <u>brown</u> dogs.

These occur together, but they are not required for the meaning or completion of the sentence.  
These adjectives are adjuncts, not arguments.
These adjuncts modify the argument “dogs”.  These are MODIFIERS.


##### Agreement :
Words may require certain morphological forms for their arguments. Often: Number, Case, Gender, etc.

**Subject-Verb Agreement**:
- In many languages, the **subject** and **verb** must agree in **number** (singular or plural) and sometimes **person** (first, second, or third).

**Noun-Adjective Agreement**:
- In some languages, **adjectives** must agree with the **nouns** they modify in terms of **number** and **gender**.

**Pronoun-Noun Agreement**:
- In languages with gendered pronouns (like **he/she/it**), the **pronoun** must agree with the **noun** it replaces in terms of **gender**, **number**, and **person**.
