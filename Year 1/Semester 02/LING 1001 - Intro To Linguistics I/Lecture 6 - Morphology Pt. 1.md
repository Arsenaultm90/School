Morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies the structure and formation of words. 
It examines how words are built from smaller meaningful units called **morphemes** and how these units interact to form new words.

#### Key Concepts in Morphology

1. **Morphemes**
    - The smallest units of meaning in a language.
    - **Example:** The word "unhappiness" consists of three morphemes:
        - _un-_ (prefix, meaning "not")
        - _happy_ (root, meaning "joyful")
        - _-ness_ (suffix, meaning "state of being")

2. **Types of Morphemes**
    - **Free Morphemes:** Can stand alone as words (e.g., _cat, run, happy_).
    - **Bound Morphemes:** Cannot stand alone and must attach to other morphemes (e.g., _-s, -ed, un-_).

3. **Types of Word Formation**
    - **Inflection:** Changing a word’s form to indicate grammatical features like tense, number, or case (e.g., _walk → walked, dog → dogs_).
    - **Derivation:** Creating new words by adding prefixes or suffixes (e.g., _happy → unhappy, teach → teacher_).
    - **Compounding:** Combining two or more words to form a new word (e.g., _toothbrush, basketball_).

4. **Allomorphs**
    - Variants of a morpheme that appear in different phonetic contexts (e.g., the plural morpheme _-s_ sounds different in _cats_ [s], _dogs_ [z], and _horses_ [ɪz]).

#### Terminology 

• Noun: person, place, or thing  
• Verb: action  
• Adjective: describes a noun  
• Adverb: describes a verb  
• Preposition: indicates the relationship between words  
• Determiner: specifies a noun  
• Conjunction: connector of words, phrases

#### Open And Closed Class Items In The Lexicon

 1. **Open-Class Words (Lexical Categories)**
These are categories that can easily expand with new words. They carry **content meaning** and are often referred to as **content words**.

**Examples of Open-Class Categories:**
- **Nouns** (e.g., _computer, pizza, dragon_)
- **Verbs** (e.g., _run, code, google_)
- **Adjectives** (e.g., _happy, bright, flexible_)
- **Adverbs** (e.g., _quickly, silently, suddenly_)


2. **Closed-Class Words (Functional Categories)**
These are categories that rarely accept new words. They serve **grammatical functions** and are often referred to as **function words**.

**Examples of Closed-Class Categories:**
    - **Pronouns** (e.g., _he, she, they, it_)
    - **Prepositions** (e.g., _in, on, under, between_)
    - **Conjunctions** (e.g., _and, but, or, because_)
    - **Determiners** (e.g., _the, a, this, those_)
    - **Auxiliary Verbs** (e.g., _is, have, will, do_)
    - **Particles** (e.g., _to_ in _to eat_, _up_ in _give up_)
