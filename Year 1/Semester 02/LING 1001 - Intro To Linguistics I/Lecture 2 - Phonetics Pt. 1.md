**Articulatory Phonetics**
	The study of the **production** of speech sounds.

**Acoustic Phonetics**
	The study of the transmission and **physical properties** of sound.

**Auditory Phonetics**
	The study of the **perception** of speech sounds.

##### Sound Segments

sit = s / i / t = 3 sound segments  
seat = s / ea / t = 3 sound segments  
witch = w / i / tch = 3 sound segments  
which = w / i / ch = 3 sound segments

##### Articulatory Phonetics

1. Voicing  
	Try: [s] versus [z] (one is voiced, one is not voiced)  
2. Place of Articulation  
	Where the sound is made – try: [p] versus [g]  
3. Manner of Articulation  
	How the sound is made – try: [t] versus [s]

**Voicing**
You can tell if a sound is voiced or voiceless by feeling for vibrations in your throat while you say the sound.

**Places of Articulation**
**Bilabial Sounds**
	both lips make a full closure together
	p, b, m, w

**Labiodental Sounds**
	lower lip against the upper front teeth  
	f, v

**Interdental Sounds**
	tip of the tongue between/behind the teeth
	$\theta-\text{(Th)igh}, \eth-\text{(Th)y}$

**Alveolar Sounds**
	tip/blade of the tongue on/near upper ridge behind the teeth
	t, d, s, z, l, ɹ, n, ɾ

**Post-Alveolar Sounds**
	tip/blade of the tongue on/near upper ridge behind the teeth
	ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ

**Palatal Sounds**
	body of the tongue near hard palate (roof of the mouth)
	j

**Velar Sounds**
	back of the tongue on/near the velum (soft palate)
	k, g, ŋ

**Glottal Sounds**
	air is stopped or constricted in the larynx (glottis)
	h, ʔ


**Manner of Articulation**
**Stop**
	Complete closure: no air escapes from the mouth  
	Closure occurs: lips, the alveolar ridge, velum, glottis

**Fricatives**
	Small opening, some air escapes with friction  
	This friction causes noisy sound: frication

**Affricates**
	Sequence of stop + fricative  
	This sequence of articulation has only one symbol

**Approximants**
	Larger opening than fricatives, so no frication  
	All approximants in English are voiced
