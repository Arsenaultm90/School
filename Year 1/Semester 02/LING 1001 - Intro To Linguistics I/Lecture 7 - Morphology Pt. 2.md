#### Compounding

In English compounds, the rightmost morpheme or head determines the part of speech of the compound. There are many possible combinations of compounds in English.

For example:  
• noun + noun = teacup (noun)  
• adjective + noun = shortcut (noun)  
• noun + verb = steamroll (verb)

#### Languages By Morphological Type

Languages can be classified by the morphological processes that they use:
1. Analytic (isolating) Languages  
	Analytic Languages use individual free morphemes to convey meaning and content (not affixes)
2. Synthetic Languages
	Synthetic Languages use bound morphemes (affixes) attached to other morphemes (roots/stems) to convey meaning and content.

#### Hierarchical Structure Of Word Formation

Consider the following and draw a tree diagram for ‘unacceptable’:  
1. What is the root?  
2. What lexical category is the root?  
3. What affix is added to the root?  
4. What word does this yield?  
5. What is its lexical category?  
6. Does it serve as the base for another affix?  
7. What is the lexical category of the word resulting from the addition of this other affix?
