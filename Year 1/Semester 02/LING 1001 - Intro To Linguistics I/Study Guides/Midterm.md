| Organ        | For Speech                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Lungs        | Supply air for speech                |
| Vocal Chords | Produce vibrations for speech sounds |
| Tongue       | Involved in articulation             |
| Teeth        | Provide a place of articulation      |
| Lips         | Involved in articulation             |
| Nose         | Provides nasal resonance             |

**The Grammars**
• Mental grammar: the lexicon and rules we have in our heads.

• Descriptive grammar: a linguist’s description of a language’s rules based on observations of linguistic performance.

• Prescriptive grammar: the socially embedded notion of the “correct” way to use the language.



---


**Design Features Of A Language**
1. Mode of communication: a means by which a message is communicated: voice, writing, gestures, signs, etc.  

2. Semanticity: a speech sound can be linked to a specific meaning

3. Arbitrariness: there is no direct link between the signal and the meaning 
	“whale” = a short word for a very large thing 
	“microorganism” = a long word for a small thing  

4. Discreteness: each unit of communication can be separated into recognizable parts (sounds, letters, signs)  

5. Displacement: describe things that are not physically present (in the past; not visible; non-  existent)

6. Cultural transmission: learning of language occurs in social groups.

7. Productivity: ability to create new messages by combining already-existing signs  

8. Interchangeability: a speaker can both receive and broadcast the same signal  

9. Pragmatic function: language is used to serve a purpose/achieve a goal



---

**Nine Ideas About Language**
1. Children learn their native language swiftly, efficiently, and largely without instruction.  
2. Language operates by rules.  
3. All languages have three major components: a sound system, a vocabulary, and a system of grammar.  
4. Everyone speaks a dialect.  
5. Speakers of all languages employ a range of styles and a set of subdialects or jargons.  
6. Language change is normal.  
7. Languages are intimately related to the societies and individuals who use them.  
8. Value judgments about different languages or dialects are matters of taste.  
9. Writing is derivative of speech.

#### Phonetics
Pt. 1
Textbook: 2.1.-2.5

The nature of speech sounds  

• How they are produced or articulated (articulatory  phonetics)  
• Their physical properties (acoustic phonetics)  
• How they are perceived (auditory / perceptual  phonetics)  
•Phonetic Alphabet: provides a symbol to represent each sound


---

**ARTICULATORY PHONETICS**  
The study of the production of speech sounds 

![[Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 10.57.06 AM.png|300]]

---

**Sound Segments**
Consider: How many sounds are in the following words?  
sit = s / i / t = 3 sound segments  
seat = s / ea / t = 3 sound segments  
witch = w / i / tch = 3 sound segments  
which = w / i / ch = 3 sound segments


---
**Syllabic Consonants**
A **syllabic consonant** is a consonant that forms the nucleus of a syllable, meaning it takes on a vowel-like role. Syllabic Consonants are **sonorous**, meaning they have a high degree of acoustic energy and can function as the peak of a syllable.

Syllabic 'm' - Possum, Chasm, Bottomless
Syllabic 'n' - Button, Chicken, Lesson
Syllabic 'l' - Little, Single, Simple
Syllabic 'ɹ̩' - Ladder, Singer, Burp, Percent, Bird


---
**Place Of Articulation**
**Bilabial Sounds**
	both lips make a full closure together

**Labiodental Sounds**
	lower lip against the upper front teeth  

**Interdental Sounds**
	tip of the tongue between/behind the teeth

**Alveolar Sounds**
	tip/blade of the tongue on/near upper ridge behind the teeth

**Post-Alveolar Sounds**
	tip/blade of the tongue on/near upper ridge behind the teeth

**Palatal Sounds**
	body of the tongue near hard palate (roof of the mouth)

**Velar Sounds**
	back of the tongue on/near the velum (soft palate)

**Glottal Sounds**
	air is stopped or constricted in the larynx (glottis)


---

**Manner of Articulation**
**Stop**
	Complete closure: no air escapes from the mouth  
	Closure occurs: lips, the alveolar ridge, velum, glottis

**Fricatives**
	Small opening, some air escapes with friction  
	This friction causes noisy sound: frication

**Affricates**
	Sequence of stop + fricative  
	This sequence of articulation has only one symbol

**Approximants**
	Larger opening than fricatives, so no frication  
	All approximants in English are voiced


**ACOUSTIC PHONETICS**  
	• the study of the transmission and physical properties of sound 
**AUDITORY PHONETICS**  
	• the study of the perception of speech sounds

Pt. 2
Textbook : Chapter 2 (Phonetics)

**English Vowels**
Consonants: sounds involving obstruction or constriction of vocal tract  

Vowels: open vocal tract  
	Vowel articulations may be harder to describe & distinguish because not as visible as consonants.
	
4 ways to describe & distinguish vowels.


---

**HART**
Height
	Tongue height: high, mid, low
Advancement
	Part of the Tongue involved: front, central, back
Rounding
	Lip rounding
Tenseness
	Vowels that are tense: more extreme positions of the tongue and/or lips


---


**Monothongs vs Diphthongs**
**Monothongs**
Vowels have a **single, steady** sound without any significant glide.

Example :
	Car, Cat, Bed, Bit, Law, Book

**Diphthongs**
Vowels involve a **glide** from one vowel sound to another within the same syllable.

Example : 
	House, Boy, Ride, Face, 


---


**Suprasegmental**
A **suprasegmental** is a feature of speech that applies to **larger units** than individual sounds (segments). Instead of focusing on single consonants or vowels, suprasegmentals influence syllables, words, or entire phrases.

- **Stress** – The emphasis placed on certain syllables in a word.
    - Example: _'PREsent_ (noun) vs. _pre'SENT_ (verb).
    - Stressed syllables are louder, longer, and higher in pitch.

- **Intonation** – The rise and fall of pitch across a sentence, affecting meaning.
    - Example: _"You're coming?"_ (rising intonation = question).
    - _"You're coming."_ (falling intonation = statement).

- **Tone** – The use of pitch to change the meaning of a word (common in tonal languages like Mandarin).
    - Example (Mandarin Chinese):
        - **mā (妈)** → "mother" (high tone)
        - **mǎ (马)** → "horse" (falling-rising tone)

- **Length** – The duration of a sound, which can change meaning in some languages.
    - Example (Finnish):
        - **tuli** = "fire"
        - **tuuli** = "wind"

- **Rhythm** – The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in speech.
    - English has a **stress-timed** rhythm (some syllables are longer).
    - French has a **syllable-timed** rhythm (each syllable is about the same length).

#### Phonology
Textbook : Sections 3.1.-3.2.6

The organization of speech sounds  

• Speech sounds are governed by rules that may cause their pronunciation to vary and may affect their positions in words


**Syllable**
In **syllable structure**, a syllable consists of three possible parts:

1. **Onset** – The consonant(s) before the vowel.
2. **Nucleus** – The vowel or syllabic sound (core of the syllable).
3. **Coda** – The consonant(s) after the vowel.

Together, the **nucleus + coda** form the **rime**.

| Word | Onset | Nucleus | Coda |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| Cat  | /k/   | /ae/    | /t/  |
| Bit  | /b/   | /i/     | /t/  |
| Sky  | /sk/  | /aI/    | -    |

**Phonotactic Constraints**
	Which sound sequences are possible / not possible

Examples :
	knife, pneumonia, Ptolemy, gnat



---
**Phonemes**
A **phoneme** is the smallest unit of sound that can **change the meaning** of a word. It is an **abstract category** in a language’s sound system.

Example: **/p/** and **/b/** in English are different phonemes because they create different words:
- _pat_ /pæt/ vs. _bat_ /bæt/


**Allophones**
An **allophone** is a **variant** of a phoneme that does **not** change the meaning of a word. Different allophones occur in different contexts but are perceived as the same sound by native speakers.

Example: The English phoneme **/p/** has two allophones:
- **Aspirated [pʰ]** → _pit_ [pʰɪt] (with a puff of air)
- **Unaspirated [p]** → _spit_ [spɪt] (no puff of air)
top [tʰɑp] [t] -> [tʰ]  
stop [stɑp] [t] -> [t]  
kitten [kɪʔən] [t] -> [ʔ]  
writer [ɹaɪɾəɹ] [t] -> [ɾ]


**Contrastive, Allophonic, Free Variation**
![[Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 2.55.17 PM.png]]

**Contrastive Distribution**
**Definition:**
	Two sounds are in contrastive distribution if replacing one sound with the other in a word changes the meaning. These sounds are considered separate phonemes.
	
**Key Feature:** 
	They create minimal pairs, which are pairs of words that differ by only one sound and have different meanings.

 **Examples**:
- /p/ vs. /b/ in _pat_ /pæt/ vs. _bat_ /bæt/
    - Changing **/p/** to **/b/** results in a different word with a different meaning, so /p/ and /b/ are contrastive phonemes.
- /k/ vs. /g/ in _cap_ /kæp/ vs. _gap_ /gæp/
    - Changing **/k/** to **/g/** also changes the meaning.


**Allophonic Distribution**
 **Definition**: 
	 Two sounds are in allophonic distribution if they are **different realizations (variants)** of the same phoneme. These allophones do not **change the meaning** of the word and are context-dependent.

**Key Feature**: 
	Allophones occur in different phonetic environments but are **perceived as the same sound** by native speakers. Allophonic variation is not contrastive, and the choice of one allophone over another does not affect the meaning.

 **Examples**:
- /pʰ/ vs. /p/ in _pat_ [pʰæt] (aspirated) vs. _spat_ [spæt] (unaspirated)
    - The sound **/p/** is pronounced differently (with aspiration in _pat_ and without in _spat_), but it does not change the meaning of the word, so these are allophones of the same phoneme /p/.
- /tʰ/ vs. /t/ in _top_ [tʰɑp] vs. _stop_ [stɑp]
    - Again, the sound /t/ is pronounced with and without aspiration, but it doesn't alter the meaning of the words. These are allophones of the same phoneme /t/.


**Free Variation**
**Definition**: 
	 Two sounds are in free variation if they can **appear in the same environment** and the **choice between them** does not affect the meaning. Unlike allophones, free variation is not determined by phonetic context but by speaker choice or style.

**Key Feature**: 
	These sounds are not constrained by specific environments like allophones. They are **interchangeable** in the same context, and their use is **often stylistic** or **idiolectal** (specific to individual speakers or dialects).

**Examples**:
[t] vs. [ʔ] in _butter_ (in American English, you might hear either [ˈbʌɾɚ] or [ˈbʌʔɚ]).
    Some speakers may pronounce the **/t/** as a flap [ɾ], while others may use a glottal stop [ʔ], but neither changes the meaning of the word. These are examples of free variation in the pronunciation of the same phoneme /t/.
[h] vs. [ʔ] in some dialects of English:
     In some accents, the **/h/** sound may be pronounced [h] in _he_ but could be omitted or replaced by a glottal stop [ʔ] without affecting meaning (as in _'e_ for _he_). This is free variation.


---
**Phonemic vs. Phonetic Representation**
**Phonemic Representation**
	To show **distinctive sounds** (phonemes)
	Abstract and general, no phonetic details

Example :
_cat_ → /kæt/


**Phonetic Representation**
To show the **actual sounds** (including allophonic variations).
Detailed and specific, includes articulation info.

_cat_ → [kʰæt] (aspirated) or [kæt] (non-aspirated)


**Example :** 
- **Word**: _bat_
    
    - **Phonemic Representation**: /bæt/
        - Shows the distinct phonemes /b/, /æ/, and /t/.
    - **Phonetic Representation**: [bæʔt]
        - The **[ʔ]** represents a glottal stop that may occur as an allophone of /t/ in some dialects, showing more precise pronunciation.
- **Word**: _top_
    
    - **Phonemic Representation**: /tɑp/
        - Only the phonemes are noted, without showing whether the /t/ is aspirated.
    - **Phonetic Representation**: [tʰɑp]
        - The **[tʰ]** indicates the aspirated form of the /t/ sound.


**Phonological Processes**
1. **Assimilation**
- **Definition**: A sound changes to become more like a neighboring sound, typically to ease pronunciation. It can involve changes in place of articulation, manner, or voicing.
- **Types**:
    - **Progressive Assimilation**: The sound changes to match a previous sound.
    - **Regressive Assimilation**: The sound changes to match a following sound.

 **Examples**:
- **Voicing Assimilation**:
    - _"dogs"_ [dɔɡz] → The plural /s/ becomes **[z]** due to the voicing of the final /ɡ/ sound.
- **Place Assimilation**:
    - _"input"_ [ˈɪmpʊt] → The /n/ changes to [m] before the bilabial /p/.

2. **Elision (Deletion)**
- **Definition**: The omission of a sound, often to simplify speech or because it's not needed for understanding. This often occurs with unstressed vowels or consonants.

**Examples**:
- _"camera"_ → [ˈkæmɚə] (the middle /ə/ is deleted in casual speech).
- _"handbag"_ → [ˈhænbæg] (the /d/ is omitted).

3. **Epenthesis**
- **Definition**: The insertion of a sound, usually a vowel, to make the pronunciation smoother or easier.

 **Examples**:
- _"athlete"_ → [ˈæθəlit] (the /ə/ is inserted).
- _"hamster"_ → [ˈhæmpstɚ] (an extra /p/ is inserted in some dialects).

4. **Metathesis**
- **Definition**: The rearrangement or switching of sounds in a word.

 **Examples**:
- _"ask"_ → [æks] (the /s/ and /k/ sounds are switched).
- _"comfortable"_ → [ˈkʌmftərbəl] (the /t/ and /r/ are swapped in casual speech).

 5. **Vowel Reduction**
- **Definition**: Unstressed vowels are pronounced less clearly and typically become a **schwa** /ə/ or a similar reduced form.

 **Examples**:
- _"banana"_ → [bəˈnænə] (the unstressed vowels become a schwa).
- _"sofa"_ → [ˈsoʊfə] (the second vowel becomes a schwa).

 6. **Flapping** (in American English)
- **Definition**: The /t/ or /d/ sound is pronounced as a **flap** [ɾ] when it occurs between two vowels, with the second vowel being unstressed.

**Examples**:
- _"butter"_ → [ˈbʌɾɚ]
- _"ladder"_ → [ˈlæɾɚ]

 7. **Insertion of /j/ or /w/**
- **Definition**: In some languages, the semivowel /j/ or /w/ is inserted between certain vowels or consonants to maintain smooth pronunciation.

**Examples**:
- _"myth"_: In some dialects, it may be pronounced **[mjɪθ]** (with /j/ inserted between /m/ and /ɪ/).
