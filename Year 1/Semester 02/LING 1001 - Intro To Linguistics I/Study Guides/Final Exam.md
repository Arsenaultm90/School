##  **Morphology**
###  The structure and formation of words


### ➤ **What is a morpheme?**
- The **smallest unit of meaning**.
    - _e.g.,_ `unhappiness` = `un-` + `happy` + `-ness` (3 morphemes)
        

---

### ➤ **Free vs. Bound Morphemes**
- **Free morphemes**: Can stand alone (_dog, run_)
- **Bound morphemes**: Must attach to something (_-ed, -s, re-_).
    

---

### ➤ **Root vs. Affix**
- **Root**: Core part of a word with meaning.
    - _e.g.,_ `help` in `helpful`
        
- **Affix**: Added to roots. Can be:
    - **Prefix**: Before root (_re-play_)
    - **Suffix**: After root (_quick-ly_)
    - **Infix** (rare in English): Inside root (_fan-bloody-tastic_)
        

---

### ➤ **Derivation vs. Inflection**

- **Derivation**: Changes meaning or **category** of a word.
    - _teach → teacher_ (verb → noun)
        
- **Inflection**: Adds **grammatical** info (tense, number, etc.).
    - _cat → cats_, _walk → walked_
        

---

### ➤ **Word Formation Processes**

- **Compounding**: Combining words (_toothbrush, laptop_)
- **Internal change**: Vowel changes (_sing → sang_)
- **Reduplication**:
    - **Full**: _bye-bye, go-go_
    - **Partial**: _chit-chat, flip-flop_
- **Conversion**: Changing category without changing form (_Google → to Google_)
    

---

## **Syntax**
### The structure of strings of words

### ➤ **Phrase vs. Clause vs. Sentence**
- **Phrase**: Group of words without subject + verb (_the big dog_)
- **Clause**: Has subject + predicate (_She runs_)
- **Sentence**: Independent clause that expresses a complete thought

---

### ➤ **Syntactic Categories**
- **Noun (N)**, **Verb (V)**, **Adjective (Adj)**, **Adverb (Adv)**, **Preposition (P)**, **Determiner (Det)**, etc.

---

### ➤ **Phrase Structures**

- NP: Noun Phrase → _(Det) (Adj) N (PP)_
- VP: Verb Phrase → _V (NP) (PP) (AdvP)_
- PP: Prepositional Phrase → _P NP_
- TP: Tense Phrase → _(Spec) T VP_
- CP: Complementizer Phrase → _(Spec) C TP_

---

### ➤ **Constituents & Tests**

- **Constituent**: A unit that functions as a single group
- **Tests**:
    - **Substitution** (replace with pronoun)
    - **Movement** (fronting)
    - **Question formation** (wh-questions)

---

### ➤ **Heads of Phrases**

- The **core word** that determines the type of phrase:
    - _[NP **the dog**]_ → **Noun** is the head
    - _[VP **ate the cake**]_ → **Verb** is the head
        

---

### ➤ **Argument vs. Adjunct**

- **Argument**: Required by the verb.
    - _She gave [him] [a book]._
        
- **Adjunct**: Optional modifier.
    - _She gave him a book [on Monday]._
        

---

### ➤ **Complement**

- A **type of argument** — completes the verb.
    - _I know [that she left]._
        

---

### ➤ **Specifier**

- Positioned at the **edge** of a phrase (e.g., Determiner in NP)
    - _[NP **The** cat]_ → "The" is the specifier
        

---

### ➤ **Deep Structure vs. Surface Structure**

- **Deep Structure**: Underlying logical structure (before movement)
- **Surface Structure**: Final word order after syntactic processes
    

---

### ➤ **Syntactic Movements**

- **Verb Raising**: Verb moves to T
- **Inversion**: Subject and auxiliary swap (in questions)
- **Wh-Movement**: Wh-word moves to front
    - _You saw who → Who did you see?_
        

---

## **Semantics**
###  Meaning in language

---

### ➤ **Lexical vs. Structural Ambiguity**
- **Lexical**: Word has multiple meanings (_bank_)
- **Structural**: Sentence has multiple possible trees
    - _I saw the man with a telescope._
        

---

### ➤ **Word Relationships**

| Term         | Description                       | Example                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Antonym**  | Opposites                         | _hot / cold_              |
| **Synonym**  | Same/similar meanings             | _big / large_             |
| **Polysemy** | One word, related meanings        | _paper_ (essay, material) |
| **Homonym**  | One word form, unrelated meanings | _bat_ (animal, baseball)  |


---


### ➤  **Truth Conditions**
- **Entailment**: A → B
    - _He was assassinated → He is dead_
- **Contradiction**: A & B can’t both be true
    - _The cat is alive and dead_
- **Paraphrase**: A ⇄ B
    - _The dog chased the cat = The cat was chased by the dog_


---

### ➤ **Presupposition**
- Assumed to be true for the sentence to make sense
    - _"Have you stopped smoking?"_ → presupposes that you **did** smoke
        

---

### ➤ **Thematic Roles**
- **Agent**: Doer (John)
- **Theme/Patient**: Undergoes action (book)
- **Experiencer**: Feels (She felt cold)
- **Goal**: Toward which action moves (to Mary)
- **Source**: From which action moves (from Bob)
- **Instrument**: Used to do something (with a hammer)

→ **Assigned by the verb** (lexically encoded)

---

### ➤ **Conversational Implicature**
- **Implied meaning** from context and maxims
    - _A: “Is Sam coming?” B: “His car’s outside.”_ → Implies **yes**
        

---

### ➤ **Grice’s 4 Maxims**
1. **Quantity** – Be informative, not too much or too little
2. **Quality** – Be truthful
3. **Relation** – Be relevant
4. **Manner** – Be clear, brief, and orderly
