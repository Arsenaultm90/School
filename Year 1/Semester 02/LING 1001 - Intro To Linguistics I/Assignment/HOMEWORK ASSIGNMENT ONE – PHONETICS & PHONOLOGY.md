### PART THREE

### PART FOUR
Answer the following PHONOLOGY questions based on the story in Part One.
For each question, state the change that has occurred [1 point] and name the phonological
process [1 point]. For example, X has become Y. This is a process of Z. The first is done for
you as an example. [8 points total]

**A) In the transcription, describe the phonological process that has occurred in the word “it”.**
The phoneme /t/ has changed to a tap/flap. This is a process of lenition.

**B) In the first line, describe the phonological process that has occurred in the word “and”.**
The /nd/ sound in the word 'And' has become [n]. This is a process of elision.

**C) In the transcription, describe the phonological process that has occurred in the word**
**“morning”.**
The vowel '/i/' has been nasalized, as shown by the tilde above the and the /ng/ is pronounced as [ŋ]. This is a process of nasalization.

**D) In the transcription, describe the phonological process that has occurred in the word “too”.**
The word 'too' has had a 'w' added to its phonological form. This is a process of epenthesis.

**E) In the transcription, describe the phonological process that has occurred in the word**
**“something”. This must not be the same process as already listed above in PART FOUR C.**
The word 'something' has a 'p' sound added to the phonological form due to 'm' influencing adjacent sounds. This is a process of assimilation.
