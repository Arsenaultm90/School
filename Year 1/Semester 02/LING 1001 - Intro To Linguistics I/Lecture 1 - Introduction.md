##### Linguistics

The scientific study of language and its structure, including the study of morphology, syntax, phonetics, and semantics. Specific branches of linguistics include [sociolinguistics](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=434236f4e3901b15&sxsrf=ADLYWIKp3li97GVlhcCrR32ql_XomPovRw:1736338934589&q=sociolinguistics&si=ACC90nxgmZHWZpVKM1-N6qpNGl1Psd45eNQAKT-VtXMldQN2_fNk1tdL5hKtQ3ZYkq_EjF2Fi649SsL6-4zXpnRewoX5DRqbpsgdl5fjTfYcnZqwYDEU120eWzClg2fo1nVy2OXgQ7b2&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5lp_LjuaKAxWUFFkFHQtPFNEQyecJegQIHhAO), [dialectology](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=434236f4e3901b15&sxsrf=ADLYWIKp3li97GVlhcCrR32ql_XomPovRw:1736338934589&q=dialectology&si=ACC90nxkzgN-KbLuTWKT81WCi4_naV9EY7u4u6c3TQeZ3HNVDfL1U0sEljjSJ2HD6TKh696ORp94oEmIdKUcCrNXRyT_gXfrV1OP1rlVVtFbw2ZOcn5agiE%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5lp_LjuaKAxWUFFkFHQtPFNEQyecJegQIHhAP), [psycholinguistics](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=434236f4e3901b15&sxsrf=ADLYWIKp3li97GVlhcCrR32ql_XomPovRw:1736338934589&q=psycholinguistics&si=ACC90nxUNmLCsZTEalUzoOnRYklFZnuCvP0f95h-orQzWyyFWZ-ba-6Xt816ySrJuTx5a_i_tBOlBXQNC1FAhTicdJ8mqeWRatf4tbDDAvSJDt33rl8C4d7Zf9NWwOnp2ZZv56W5G43-&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5lp_LjuaKAxWUFFkFHQtPFNEQyecJegQIHhAQ), computational linguistics, historical-comparative linguistics, and applied linguistics.

##### Definitions

**Phonetics :** The study of how humans produce and perceive speech sounds, and how to classify those sounds.

**Phonology :** The study of how languages organize their phonemes, or the smallest units of sound that have meaning.

**Morphology :** The study of how words are constructed and the morphemes that make them up.

**Syntax :** A linguistic concept that refers to the rules that govern how words are combined to form sentences, phrases, and clauses.

**Semantics :** A sub-discipline of linguistics that studies how meaning is constructed, interpreted, and negotiated in language.

##### The Grammars

**Mental grammar :** The lexicon and rules we have in our heads.

**Descriptive grammar :** A linguist’s description of a language’s rules based on observations of linguistic performance.

**Prescriptive grammar :** The socially embedded notion of the “correct” way to use the language.

##### Hockett’s 9 Descriptive Characteristics of Language

1. **Mode of communication:** a means by which a message is communicated: voice, writing,  gestures, signs, etc.  

2. **Semanticity:** a speech sound can be linked to a specific meaning.

3. **Arbitrariness:** There is no direct link between the signal and the meaning.
   “whale” = a short word for a very large thing.
   “microorganism” = a long word for a small thing.

4. **Discreteness:** Each unit of communication can be separated into recognizable parts (sounds, letters, signs).

5. **Displacement:** Describe things that are not physically present (in the past; not visible; non-  existent).

6. **Cultural transmission:** learning of language occurs in social groups. 

7. **Productivity:** ability to create new messages by combining already-existing signs.

8. **Interchangeability:** a speaker can both receive and broadcast the same signal.

9. **Pragmatic function:** language is used to serve a purpose/achieve a goal.
