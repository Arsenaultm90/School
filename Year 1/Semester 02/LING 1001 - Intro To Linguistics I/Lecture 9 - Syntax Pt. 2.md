#### Syntactic Constituency

Words that are found within larger phrases can be grouped to form constituents.
<u>The fluffy cat</u> <u>was sleeping</u> <u>on the desk</u>.

**How can we recognize Constituents?**
A. Make a question. The (short) answer is a constituent.  
B. Can you change a possible constituent into a question? If yes = constituent.

Example:  
	Q: What was sleeping on the desk? A: The fluffy cat.  
	Q: Where was the fluffy cat sleeping? A: on the desk  
	Q: What was the fluffy cat doing? A: (it) was sleeping



**Movement(Clefting) :**
Some constituent is displaced (moved to another location)
	It was <u>on the desk</u> that the cat was sleeping.

**Substitutions :** 
Substitute a possible constituent with a pro-form (pronoun, verb, etc.).
	<u>She</u> was sleeping on the desk.
