##### Diphtongs
Complex vowels like [aj] involve a continuous movement of the tongue body from one position to another: diphthong  

Transcription: the first symbol represents the starting point of the tongue body (vowel) and the second symbol represents the direction of movement (glide)

##### Suprasegmentals

**Segment :** small unit = phoneme [m]  
**Suprasegmental :** features above the segment or affecting larger units

- **Lengthening**:  
    Lengthening refers to the increased duration of a speech sound (vowel or consonant) relative to its typical production. This can indicate emphasis, grammatical function, or other linguistic distinctions. For example, in some languages, vowel length can differentiate word meanings (e.g., in Japanese, _kite_ [short vowel] means "come," while _kiite_ [lengthened vowel] means "listen").
    
- **Intonation Contour**:  
    The intonation contour is the pattern or shape of pitch variation across an utterance. It conveys meaning beyond the literal words, such as indicating questions, statements, emotions, or emphasis. For example, rising intonation often signals a question in English, while falling intonation can signal a statement.
    
- **Tone**:  
    Tone refers to the use of pitch to distinguish word meanings in tonal languages. Each tone assigns a specific pitch pattern (e.g., high, low, rising, or falling) to a syllable, which can change the meaning of the word. For example, in Mandarin Chinese, _mā_ (high tone) means "mother," while _mà_ (falling tone) means "scold."
    
- **Stress**:  
    Stress is the emphasis placed on a particular syllable within a word or phrase. This emphasis can be realized through increased loudness, pitch, or duration. Stress is often used to distinguish word meanings or grammatical forms, as in English: _record_ (noun, stress on the first syllable) versus _record_ (verb, stress on the second syllable).
