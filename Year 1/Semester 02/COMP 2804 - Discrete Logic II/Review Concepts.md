#### Permutations
Consider a group of 5 people. Each person in this group was born in a uniformly randomn month (from the 12 months of the year), independent of the other peopleâ€™s month of birth.

What is the probability that at least 2 of these 5 people were born in the same month?

Number of options for each month : $12^5$
Number of permutations : $\frac{12!}{(12-5)!}$
Probability AT LEAST 2 of 5 we born in the same month : $\frac{\frac{12!}{7!}}{12^5}$

#### Circular Permutations


#### Binomial Identity
$\sum^n_{k=0} \binom{n}{k}x^k = (1+x)^n$


#### Probability of $x=y=z$ from set $A = \{1, 2, \dots, 100\}$
$\frac{100}{100^3} = \frac{1}{100^2}$
