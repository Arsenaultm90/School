##### Congruences

Mathematical congruences refer to a relationship between integers that have the same remainder when divided by a specific integer, often called the modulus. In simpler terms, two numbers are congruent modulo mmm if they give the same remainder when divided by mmm.

For example, in modulo arithmetic:

- a≡b(mod m) means a and b have the same remainder when divided by m.
- This can be expressed as a−b is divisible by m, or a=b+km for some integer k.

For any composite number $x$, one of its prime factors must be less than or equal to $\sqrt{ x }$.

**Example :**
$$\sqrt{ 119} = 10.9$$
Given that we the square root of 119  is 10.9, we can determine that one of the prime factors of this composite number is less than 10.9.

Those number are 2, 3, 5, 7. 

Since we know 2 and 5 don't factor into 119 evenly we can omit those. So what we are left with is 3 and 7.$$\frac{119}{7} = 17$$
Now we know that 119 is a composite number and its prime factors are $7$ and $17$.
