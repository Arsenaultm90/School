##### Kilns

**Sintering :**
	A heat treatment process that uses high temperatures to bond a mass of powder particles into a solid, coherent, and stronger mass without melting it to the point of liquefaction.

**Bonfire Kiln**
	Won't reach more than 800C
	Usually dung as fuel
	Cannot sinter
	Encloses the pots

**Updraft Kiln**
	Won't reach more than 1000C
	Wood is used as fuel
	Pots are above the fire
	Inefficient - heat rises but dissipates quickly
	Unlikely to sinter

**Downdraft Kiln**
	Wood fire fuel source
	Heat goes downward around pots
	Gases settle at bottom of kiln
	Higher temperatures attained and maintained
	Heat source at one end, chimney at the other -> Air flow + uniform heat/temperature
	A maximum of 1200C and reliably above 1000C

**Muffle Kiln**
	Double Skin
	Pots sealed in inner chamber
	Keeps smoke and ember from pots
	Less efficient for heating and air flow
	Mainly used in large scale production

**Charcoal Mounds**
	Pyrolysis - Requires reducing of oxygen
	Burns up to 1200C
	Surface layer burns immediately at 220°C and begins to become ash at 310°C

A majority of kilns are proven by ceramic wasters and not by finding the kilns themselves.

#### **Glass**

##### Glass Making - Sumeria
**Composition :**
	Pounded quartz pebbles
	Plant ash

<font color="#e36c09">Frit : The mixture of silica and fluxes which is fused at high temperature to make glass.</font>
	Fired at 750C
	Started around 4000BC in the fertile crescent

<font color="#e36c09">Signature inclusions</font>
In ancient glassmaking, **signature inclusions** refer to **tiny particles or features trapped inside the glass** that are _characteristic of a specific place, technique, or time period_.  
They act like a “fingerprint” for the glass.

Armana - Blue
Qantir - White
Ramesside - Red


<font color="#e36c09">Royal Monopoly</font>
In ancient Egypt, a **royal monopoly** means that **the production and control of a commodity were restricted to the pharaoh’s authority**.

They had monopolies on the colours Red, Blue, Gold, and on Glass Frit.

##### How To Make A Pot
Must go into the kiln three times.

**Phase I : Oxidizing**
	Pots are stacked in a kiln
	Temperatures raised to 800C
	Air comes through the ceiling
	Entire pot turns red (Including painted sections)

**Phase II : Reducing**
	Wet or green wood put on fire
	Air sources closed off
	Temperature raised to 900C
	All pots turn black, painted sections are vitrified

**Phase III : Oxidizing**
	Air sources opened
	Wet/Green wood added
	Oxygen re-enters kiln
	Parts that are painted do not change. 
	The iron in the clay rusts and turns red

**Khnum** was the Egyptian patron deity of potters.
Athena was the Greek patron deity of potters

Pottery wheels

<font color="#e36c09">Tempering</font>
	Impurities (inclusions) left in or added for special qualities for special classes of pottery.
	Lime - To cool the inside
	Chert - to transfer heat better (Chryoplastic)

Patera
	Ritual bowl for offerings of grain, honey, and wine

<font color="#e36c09">Iconography</font>
	Identifying marks

Eye Cups
Panathenaic Vases


#### Pots For The Gods
Made specifically for dedication and filled with wine.
The gods did not care and only wanted to be remembered.


#### Sex and Ceramics
**Friendship Cups**
	Given to younger men from older men
	Philias - Friend
	Erotos - Lover


Etruscans buy crappy vases because they don't know either way. The like the art to be sexual in nature.
