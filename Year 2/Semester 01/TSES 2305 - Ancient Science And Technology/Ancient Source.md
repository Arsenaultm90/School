**Plutarch, Moralia. On the Eating of the Flesh.**

  
1. **Contents+**
    
In his essay *On the Eating of Flesh*, Plutarch explores the moral, ethical, and natural implications of consuming animals, arguing that humans should abstain from meat except in extreme necessity. Through appeals to human nature, cultural tradition, and ethical reasoning, he seeks to persuade readers to reconsider gluttonous or wanton consumption of animal flesh. This paper analyzes Plutarch’s methods of argument, evaluates the accuracy and usefulness of his claims, and considers how his work fits within both ancient and modern discussions of diet and ethics.

Plutarch repeatedly argues that humans are not physically built to eat meat, using comparisons to predatory animals and observations of human anatomy. He notes that human teeth lack the sharpness of carnivorous predators, and that humans do not possess claws or other natural hunting tools, which he interprets as evidence that humans are naturally suited for a plant-based diet (Tract 1, paras. 1, 3; Tract 2, para. 1). He also emphasizes digestive differences, suggesting that human bodies are ill-equipped to process meat and more compatible with fruits, vegetables, and grains (Tract 1, para. 3; Tract 2, para. 4). In making these observations, Plutarch intertwines physiological reasoning with ethical implications, implying that because humans are not predatory by nature, killing animals for food is unnatural and morally questionable (Tract 2, para. 6). While these claims are grounded in a more observational capacity, they reflect the assumptions and limited biological knowledge of his time, even though humans are naturally able to eat both plants and meat, yet capable of thriving on a plant-based diet.

In addition to anatomical observations, Plutarch strengthens his argument through comparisons between humans and other animals. He repeatedly contrasts humans with predators, emphasizing that lions, wolves, and other meat-eaters possess specialized teeth, claws, and instincts for hunting, while humans rely on tools and cooperation rather than physical predation (Tract 1, para. 7; Tract 2, para. 1). He also invokes cultural and historical examples, referring to the mythic “Golden Age” when humans allegedly subsisted entirely on fruits, grains, and other plant-based foods, portraying meat-eating as a later development associated with moral and societal decline (Tract 1, para. 4; Tract 2, para. 3). Through these comparisons, Plutarch reinforces the idea that human consumption of animals is both unnatural and ethically problematic.

While Plutarch favors an observational approach in comparing humans to carnivores, he overlooks the fact that differences between species extend beyond physical characteristics. His argument assumes that if humans are not naturally carnivorous, they must be herbivorous, ignoring the possibility that humans are omnivores capable of consuming both plants and meat. Human anatomy and hunting behaviors suggest flexibility in dietary practices rather than strict specialization. Plutarch reinforces his claim by referencing the Golden Age, during which humans supposedly consumed only plant-based diets, but he provides no empirical evidence, making this an anecdotal or mythological claim rather than historical fact. His discussion of the ethical implications of eating meat similarly relies on comparisons to animals and their physical traits. Nevertheless, Plutarch’s ethical point remains relevant, as the moral considerations he raises about meat consumption continue to relate to modern debates on animal welfare and environmental impact.

Although Plutarch’s claims about human anatomy and diet invite critique, his discussion of the ethical implications of meat consumption moves beyond physical reasoning, emphasizing moral responsibility and the treatment of animals. The next section examines how he frames meat-eating as an ethical and moral concern.

Plutarch’s ethical argument against meat-eating emphasizes the moral responsibility unique to humans. Unlike other animals, humans have the capacity for reason and can choose whether or not to inflict harm; thus, killing animals for food, particularly out of gluttony or habit, is ethically problematic (Tract 1, para. 2; Tract 2, para. 5). He portrays slaughter as inherently cruel, arguing that humans lack the natural predatory traits necessary for hunting, so causing suffering to animals is both unnatural and morally objectionable (Tract 1, para. 5; Tract 2, para. 6). Plutarch also states his ethical reasoning in a cultural and historical context, citing the Golden Age when humans allegedly ate only plant-based diets, framing this earlier period as morally superior and linking meat consumption to societal decline (Tract 1, para. 4; Tract 2, para. 3). Through repetition and appeals to both reason and compassion, Plutarch constructs a layered ethical argument designed to persuade his audience that abstaining from meat is a virtuous choice.

While Plutarch presents a compelling moral argument against meat-eating, his claims rely heavily on assumptions about human nature and comparisons to animals that may not fully hold up under scrutiny. His reasoning assumes that humans, lacking predatory traits, are morally obligated to abstain from killing animals, but this overlooks the complexity of human dietary behavior and cultural practices. Moreover, his references to the Golden Age are anecdotal and mythological, providing little empirical support for the ethical conclusions he draws. From a modern perspective, ethical arguments about meat consumption are often grounded in considerations such as sustainability, animal welfare, and environmental impact, rather than solely on human anatomy or comparisons to other species.
