**Plutarch, Moralia. On the Eating of the Flesh.**



**SUMMARY**
Plutarch’s _On the Eating of Flesh_ is made up of two essays where he argues against eating meat. Across both pieces, Plutarch presents one of the earlier defenses of vegetarianism, describing meat-eating as something unnatural, unnecessary, cruel, and morally corrupting.

The first essay starts with a question. Instead of asking why Pythagoras refused to eat meat, Plutarch wonders how the first person ever decided to eat an animal at all. He paints a vivid and almost disturbing picture of early humans approaching slaughtered bodies and somehow finding them appetizing, despite the blood, smell, and gore. Plutarch people to see meat-eating as something horrifying that needs justification.

From there, he builds his main argument around the idea that humans are not physically designed to eat meat. He points out that people don’t have claws, sharp teeth, or the strong stomachs of carnivorous animals. Instead, our smaller mouths, flat teeth, and soft tongues seem better suited to a plant-based diet. To make his point, Plutarch even challenges readers to try eating meat the way predators do, using only their teeth and hands, while the animal is still alive. While extreme, it captures his view that humans only eat meat by going against their natural design.

Plutarch also argues that humans have to disguise meat to make it edible. Unlike animals that can eat raw flesh, people must cook, season, and cover it with spices to hide its true taste. He uses a story about a Spartan who joked that if he already had cheese, vinegar, and oil, he wouldn’t need to buy fish. For Plutarch, this shows that meat isn’t naturally appealing to humans; we have to trick ourselves into liking it.

He then moves into historical reasoning, suggesting that early people only started eating meat during disasters like floods or famines, when plants weren’t available. What began as a desperate survival habit eventually became a cultural norm. So for Plutarch, continuing to eat meat in times of plenty doesn’t make sense, it’s just an outdated custom that people never questioned.

The moral side of his argument is the most in depth part of his essays. Plutarch says that eating meat makes people cruel and numb to suffering. He describes gruesome cooking methods like burning pigs alive, crushing pregnant animals, and fattening birds in darkness for richer flavour. He uses these examples to show how humans, out of greed and luxury, have become far more violent than they need to be.

In the second essay, he compares the habit of meat-eating to being under a spell, it feels normal only because people are used to it. He urges readers to “cut out” gluttony and the craving for flesh. The problem, he says, isn’t hunger but indulgence and lack of self-control.

Finally, Plutarch challenges the idea that people owe no moral duty to animals. He hints at the possibility of reincarnation, warning that someone could unknowingly eat a soul that once belonged to a loved one. Even without that belief, he argues that cruelty toward animals harms the human soul far more than eating meat could ever benefit it.

Throughout both pieces, Plutarch uses emotional language, vivid examples, and philosophical reasoning to make his case. He admits that some people may need to eat meat to survive, but insists that if they do, it should be with regret and compassion, not pleasure. Ultimately, he portrays vegetarianism as the natural, moral, and thoughtful choice for anyone seeking to live a virtuous life.




**METHODOLOGIES**
The two essays that make up _On the Eating of Flesh_ are organized by theme. Each section connects moral ideas about why eating meat is wrong, focusing on four main arguments: that humans are not naturally built to eat meat, that people first ate meat only when food was scarce, that eating meat makes people cruel, and that modern meat-eating is driven by luxury and excess rather than necessity.

Plutarch stands out by trying to lead readers into philosophy or lifelong study, he writes to make them reflect on their everyday actions. As Duff (2011) points out, Plutarch’s moral essays often work by stirring feelings like shame or empathy to encourage readers to change their behaviour. He focuses on practical self-improvement rather than theory, using emotional and relatable examples to make his lessons memorable. His choice of material centers entirely on questions of character and ethics, showing more of his philosophical side than his factual one.

These essays function like moral parables meant to make readers think about their own ethics and habits. Plutarch uses descriptive imagery of animal slaughter to provoke compassion and discomfort. According to Newmyer (2014), one of his biggest contributions was his claim that animals show a kind of rationality through their ability to perform the essential tasks of life.




**BACKGROUND**
Plutarch of Chaeronea was a Greek Middle Platonist philosopher, biographer, essayist, and priest at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. He came from a Boeotian family and studied in Athens under the Platonist Ammonius around 66–67 CE, where he received training in philosophy, mathematics, and other subjects (Irwin, 2012). He traveled widely across the Mediterranean, including several trips to Rome to lecture on philosophy, and held municipal posts in his hometown of Chaeronea, where he also ran a philosophical school (Irwin, 2012).

Religion played a central role in his philosophy; he believed that the ultimate goal of life was to become more like the divine, though human reason alone could not fully understand god, and that divine revelation was necessary (Irwin, 2012). He also defended free will and the soul’s immortality, and argued that God had transformed matter, which could harbour evil, into the divine soul of the world (Irwin, 2012).

Plutarch wrote a large number of works. His best-known are the _Parallel Lives_ and the _Moralia_, a collection of 78 essays and speeches covering philosophy, religion, ethics, politics, and literature (Beagon, 2002). _On the Eating of Flesh_ is part of the _Moralia_ collection. These two essays promoting vegetarianism are likely extracts from a series delivered in his youth, probably to a Boeotian audience (Perrin, 1919/1957).

Plutarch was also a significant early voice in debates about animal ethics. He may have been the first author to argue for animals’ moral consideration independently of Pythagorean ideas about reincarnation (Miszczyński, 2016). He aimed to show that animals could be included in the human moral sphere, arguing that justice requires concern for the interests of other species because of the intellectual and functional kinship animals share with humans (Newmyer, 2014).




**ANALYSIS**
In his essays, Plutarch repeatedly argues that humans aren’t physically built to eat meat, using comparisons to predatory animals and observations of human anatomy. He points out that human teeth aren’t as sharp as those of carnivores, and that we don’t have claws or other natural hunting tools. From this, he concludes that humans are more suited to a plant-based diet. He also discusses digestive differences, suggesting that our bodies are better equipped for fruits, vegetables, and grains than for meat. Plutarch blends these points with ethical arguments, implying that because humans aren’t natural predators, killing animals for food is both unnatural and morally questionable. While his claims are based on observation, they reflect the limited biological knowledge of his time. Today, we know humans are omnivores, capable of eating both plants and meat, though we can thrive on a plant-based diet. Though the use of tools, fire, and cooperative hunting strategies allows us to consume meat.

Plutarch strengthens his case by comparing humans to other animals. He emphasizes that lions, wolves, and other predators have specialized teeth, claws, and instincts for hunting, whereas humans rely on tools and cooperation rather than our physical features. He also draws on cultural and historical examples, like the mythic “Golden Age,” when humans supposedly lived on plants alone, portraying meat-eating as a later development linked to moral and social decline. While these comparisons support his idea that eating meat is unnatural and ethically troubling, they also rely on anecdotal or mythological evidence rather than empirical fact. Humans across cultures and throughout history have relied on a mix of animal and plant foods to survive, particularly in regions where plant foods alone were insufficient, showing that Plutarch’s argument oversimplifies the historical and biological realities of human diets.

Plutarch also questions the idea that humans are somehow above animals. He argues that animals show their own kinds of reason, emotion, and social bonds, enough to deserve moral respect. By pointing out how animals care for their young and work together, he suggests that these traits show a shared kind of rationality. For Plutarch, ignoring this connection lets humans excuse cruelty while overlooking the good qualities in other creatures. In doing so, he is suggesting that justice and morality should include all living beings, not just people.

At the same time, Plutarch overlooks some important points. He assumes that if humans aren’t naturally carnivorous, they must be herbivorous, ignoring that we’re omnivores capable of eating both plants and meat. Our anatomy and behaviours suggest flexibility rather than strict dietary specialization.

Plutarch’s ethical argument moves beyond anatomy, focusing on humans’ moral responsibility. Unlike animals, humans can reason and make choices, so killing for pleasure or habit is ethically questionable. He describes slaughter as inherently cruel, arguing that humans lack the natural predatory traits needed for hunting, so causing suffering is both unnatural and morally wrong. He also places these arguments historically, referencing the Golden Age as a morally superior time and connecting meat-eating to societal decline. These points rest on the assumption that lacking physical predatory traits imposes a moral obligation to abstain from meat. This perspective overlooks the complexity of human diets, cultural practices, and differing ethical practices, which can approach moral concern differently.

Another part of Plutarch’s critique looks at how people use religion to justify eating meat. He argues that rituals are often used as a cover for cruelty, giving people a sense of divine approval for their actions. When people kill “for the gods,” Plutarch suggests, they’re really disguising indulgence as devotion. By pointing out this hypocrisy, he expands his argument beyond diet, showing that respect for the divine should be rooted in mercy and self-control as opposed to animal cruelty. 

Plutarch builds a strong ethical case for abstaining from meat through repeated appeals to reason, compassion, and historical precedent. Yet from a modern perspective, ethical debates about meat consumption also incorporate factors like sustainability, animal welfare, and environmental consequences, issues that extend beyond human anatomy or comparisons to other species. While Plutarch’s reasoning has limits, his combination of moral reflection, and emotional appeal remains a conducive to debates about meat consumption.



**DISCUSSION**
Reading Plutarch’s _On the Eating of Flesh_ made me realize how far back debates about ethics and diet go. While I don’t fully agree with his strict assumptions about human anatomy, I found his ethical arguments reasonably stated, especially his emphasis on compassion and moral responsibility. It was interesting to see how he linked cruelty to societal decline, a point that still resonates today when considering modern factory farming or environmental impacts of meat consumption. Overall, the essay made me think about the moral implications of everyday choices and how well history can inform current debates.
