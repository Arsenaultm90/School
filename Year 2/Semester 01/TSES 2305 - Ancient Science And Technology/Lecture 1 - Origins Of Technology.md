Nemea Archaelogical
Neolithic Idol - (10000 BC - 3000 BC)

It is made of terracotta.

The figure is schematic yet has naturalistic features: hair, eyes, folded arms; a pubic triangle; divided legs; emphasised buttocks. The body is flattened (“plank-like”), but stands free.

Found during surface survey rather than formal excavated deposit—so precise context (house, ritual pit, tomb) may not be known, which affects interpretation.

The presence of emphasised female genital features and buttocks has been interpreted by some scholars not simply as fertility symbolism, but perhaps metaphors of abundance, generational continuity or memory.

#### **Technē (τέχνη)**

**Technē** is usually translated as **“art,” “craft,” or “skill,”** but none of those fully captures the Greek meaning.

In ancient Greek thought (especially in Plato, Aristotle, and later writers), **technē** means:
- **A systematic, teachable skill**
- **A method for producing something**
- **Knowledge combined with practice**
- **Mastery gained through experience**

#### **Polyvalent**

<font color="#e36c09">Admits of multiple, simultaneous, interpretations/manifestation.</font>

**Polyvalent** means “having many meanings or functions.”  

Technē is considered polyvalent for several reasons:
**A. It covers both practical craft and intellectual knowledge**
A potter, a doctor, and a sculptor all “have technē”—but these are very different fields.

**B. It applies to making _both_ physical objects and abstract outcomes**
- A carpenter makes a table → technē
- A musician makes music → technē
- A rhetorician “produces” persuasion → also technē

Technē, unlike “technology” today, is not limited to machines or tools.

**C. It includes knowledge, skill, and judgment**
Technē is not just “doing.”  
It’s also:
- knowing _why_ something works
- being able to teach it
- using reasoned methods, not just intuition or luck

**D. It has ethical and philosophical weight**
In Greek philosophy:
- Plato contrasts **technē** (guided by knowledge) with **empeiria** (mere experience).
- Aristotle says technē involves **craft knowledge directed toward a goal (telos)**.

So technē is both:
- **a practical craft** (e.g., building a house), and
- **a philosophical category** about controlled, rational creation.

#### **Taxonomy**

**Taxonomy** simply means **a system of classification**.

The systematic classification of artifacts by material, form, function, manufacturing technique, and style to understand technological and cultural patterns.
- **how scholars categorize and understand technologies**
- **how objects relate to each other over time**
- **how styles, materials, and techniques evolve**
- **how we identify cultural groups or networks**

##### Field Dressing of Stone
The first-stage rough shaping of a stone block at or near the quarry, done to reduce weight and prepare it for transport before final finishing.

##### Splitting a stone


##### Pulverizing
Generally of soft stone by harder stone
Use mainly in plaster
Soft stones are worked early and use for vases or single story structures

##### Cutting
Restricted to wood and soft stone(soap stone, sand stone, gypsum) 


**Abrading = Sharpening**
**Burnishing = Polishing**
Generally done with wooden spatula and lubricant or polished stone

##### Coring
**Coring** is the process of removing a central “core” of material—usually from **stone or soil**—to study or use what remains.

##### Flaking
**Flaking** is the removal of thin, sharp pieces of stone (flakes) from a larger stone core by striking or pressure.

##### Open Pit Firing
A **primitive firing technique** for pottery, used before kilns existed.

##### Comparanda
**Comparanda** means “things to be compared,” used when analyzing an artifact or feature.

##### Diachronic
**Diachronic** means “across time.”
A diachronic analysis studies **how something changes over time**.

##### Synchronic
**Synchronic** means “at one moment in time.”
A synchronic analysis looks at **a single time slice**, comparing things that coexisted.

What makes it an alter and not a hearth?
	If its near or inside a tomb, an alter
	Outside a home, a hearth

#### **Speech And Writing**

##### Cultural Memory

Writing Systems:
Heiroglyphs
	A complex writing system used in ancient Egypt composed of **pictorial symbols**.
Cuneiform
	One of the earliest writing systems, developed in Mesopotamia (Sumer). Made by pressing a **wedge-shaped stylus** into clay tablets.
Pictograms
	Symbols that **represent objects or concepts visually** (e.g., drawing of a cow = “cow”).
Syllabary
	A writing system where each sign represents a **syllable** (e.g., ka, mi, to).
Alphabet
	A system where each symbol represents a **single phoneme** (sound), typically consonants _and_ vowels.
Characters
	A general term (often used in Chinese writing) where each written mark is a **character** representing:
		- a word
		- a morpheme
		- sometimes a sound component

<font color="#e36c09">Technological Lag</font>
The delay between when a technology is **invented** and when it becomes **adopted** or **widely used** by a society.

#### **The Technology Of Archaeology**

##### Mohs Hardness Scale
A scale ranking minerals from **1 (soft)** to **10 (hard)** based on what scratches what.

Used to:
- identify stone types
- understand tool durability
- evaluate carving difficulty

##### Stratigraphy
The study of **layered deposits** (strata) created over time.

##### Profiles
A **cut-away side view** of excavation layers showing stratigraphy revealed in a vertical section.

##### Core
1. **Lithic Core**
A stone from which flakes were intentionally removed to make tools.

2. **Sediment/Soil Core**
A cylindrical sample taken using a coring tool to study stratigraphy without full excavation.

**Key idea:** The parent material—either stone for toolmaking or soil for sampling.

##### Inclusions
Small particles or materials **embedded** in pottery clay, stone, or soil layers.

##### Surface
The **outermost layer** or exterior of an artifact.

##### Slip
A thin, liquid clay coating applied to pottery before firing to create:
- a smoother surface
- a new color
- reduced porosity

##### Tree Rings
Dating method based on counting and analyzing **annual growth rings** in wood.
