**Express** is a lightweight, flexible framework for building web applications and APIs in **Node.js.**
It abstracts away some of the boilerplate of Nodeâ€™s built-in HTTP module, making it easier to handle routes, requests, responses, and middleware.

**Key features:**
- Routing (mapping URLs to handlers)
- Middleware support (functions that handle requests/responses)
- Template engine support (rendering HTML)
- Easy handling of JSON, URL-encoded data, and static files
- Supports RESTful API design
